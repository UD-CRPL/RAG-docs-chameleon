8,Conceptual,"What does it mean for Chameleon to support ""deep reconfigurability""?","""Deep reconfigurability"" is the core design principle of the Chameleon testbed. It means giving researchers an unparalleled level of control over the entire software stack on physical, non-virtualized hardware. This is achieved through several key features:   

Bare Metal Access: Researchers are given exclusive access to entire physical servers, ensuring that experiments are free from the performance interference (""noise"") that can occur in shared or virtualized environments.   

Full Administrative Privileges: Users have root (sudo) access on their reserved nodes. This allows them to install a custom operating system, modify the kernel, change bootloader configurations, and access the machine's serial console.   

This level of control is essential for many areas of computer science systems research where the experiment involves modifying the operating system itself or requires precise, repeatable performance measurements.",model_1_answer,"According to the context, ""deep reconfigurability"" is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that Chameleon supports deep reconfigurability due to its ability to provide access to bare-metal machines with optional GPU and interconnection choices, as well as support for FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) which allow users to customize their hardware configuration.Source: Experiment Implementation on Chameleon and FPGAs — Chameleon Cloud Documentation",0.1206030150753769,0.7846275568008423,0.07,0.23610157208369123
9,Comparative,What is the difference between a Floating IP and a Private IP?,"On Chameleon, Private IPs and Floating IPs serve distinct networking purposes :   

Private IP (Fixed IP): This is an IP address assigned to an instance for communication within Chameleon's internal network (e.g., sharednet1). It is not directly reachable from the public internet. Instances use their private IP to communicate with each other and to initiate outbound connections to the internet through a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway.   

Floating IP: This is a publicly routable IPv4 address that can be dynamically associated with an instance. A Floating IP is required for an instance to be directly accessible from the public internet (for example, to connect via SSH from your laptop or to host a public web server). Floating IPs are a limited, shared resource, so users are encouraged to release them when they are no longer needed. ",model_1_answer,"A Floating IP is a publicly accessible IP address that can be associated with an instance, allowing it to be accessed over the public Internet. A Private IP, on the other hand, is not publicly accessible and is used for internal communication within the Chameleon Cloud. This information comes from the Chameleon Cloud documentation, specifically the section on 'Step 1: Associate an IP' and 'Step 2: Accessing Your Instance'.",0.22330097087378642,0.8111696243286133,0.21875,0.537024003142143
10,Comparative,When should I use an FPGA node versus a GPU node?,"While the Chameleon documentation does not provide a direct comparison, the choice between an FPGA and a GPU depends on the specific requirements of your research, based on the fundamental differences in their architectures :   

Use a GPU Node for: High-throughput, data-parallel computations. GPUs contain thousands of cores optimized for performing the same operation on large amounts of data simultaneously. This makes them exceptionally well-suited for the matrix and vector operations that dominate deep learning model training and inference, scientific simulations, and high-performance computing (HPC).   

Use an FPGA Node for: Latency-critical or power-sensitive applications requiring custom hardware logic. An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is a fabric of reconfigurable logic blocks, not a fixed set of cores. This allows you to design and implement a custom digital circuit optimized for a specific algorithm. FPGAs can offer advantages in low-latency processing (e.g., network packet processing, real-time signal processing), power efficiency, and for prototyping novel hardware accelerators before committing to a final chip design (ASIC).",model_1_answer,"You should use an FPGA node when you need to perform tasks that require the unique capabilities of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays, such as high-speed data processing and acceleration. On the other hand, a GPU node is more suitable for general-purpose computing and deep learning workloads.This information comes from the Chameleon documentation on FPGA nodes and their specifications: https://chameleoncloud.org/docs/fpga/",0.16033755274261602,0.792573869228363,0.1276595744680851,0.4222303946732441

15,Complex Query,How can I set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node?,"Chameleon's support for ""deep reconfigurability"" allows you to install and boot from a custom kernel on a bare metal node. The general process is as follows :   

Launch an Instance: Start by launching an instance from a ""whole disk image."" Most of the standard Chameleon-provided OS images (e.g., CC-Ubuntu20.04) are whole disk images suitable for this purpose.

Install Your Kernel: Once the instance is running, connect to it via SSH. Transfer your custom kernel and its associated modules to the instance and install them.

Modify the Bootloader: With root privileges, edit the bootloader configuration file (e.g., /boot/grub2/grub.cfg). Add a new menu entry that points to your new kernel and ramdisk files. You can also specify any custom kernel command-line parameters in this entry.

Reboot: Reboot the node. It will now boot using your specified custom kernel.

Note that for the cc-snapshot tool to work correctly with your custom environment, the size of your kernel's modules directory (/lib/modules/<kernel_version>) must be less than 4GB. ",model_1_answer,"To set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node, you can use the Bare Metal Experiment Pattern from the Trovi repository.

17,How-To,How do I launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates?,"You can automate the deployment of complex, multi-node topologies using OpenStack's Heat orchestration service. The process uses a declarative YAML file called a Heat Orchestration Template (HOT).   

Here is the workflow to launch a multi-node ""stack"" :   

Create a Reservation: First, you must have an active lease with enough nodes to accommodate your entire deployment (e.g., if your template defines 1 server and 3 clients, you need a reservation for at least 4 nodes).

Navigate to Orchestration: In the Chameleon dashboard, go to Project > Orchestration > Stacks.

Launch Stack: Click the Launch Stack button.

Select Template: Specify your Heat template. You can upload the YAML file, paste its contents directly, or provide a URL to a template hosted online.

Enter Parameters: The interface will prompt you to enter values for any parameters defined in the template. This will always include a name for the stack, your password, the ID of your reservation, and an SSH key. It may also include custom parameters, like the number of client nodes to create.

Launch: Click Launch. Heat will then automatically provision all the resources—instances, networks, routers, etc.—as defined in your template.",model_1_answer,"To launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates, you need to create a Complex Appliance which includes the image, template, and other configuration details.

19,Troubleshooting,"Why can't my instance access the internet, even with a floating IP?","The most common reason an instance with a floating IP cannot be accessed from the internet is due to the host-based firewall running on the instance itself.   

Chameleon's supported operating system images (like Ubuntu and CentOS) are pre-configured with firewalld enabled by default for security. This firewall has restrictive rules that block most incoming connections from the public internet.   

To solve this, you must connect to your instance (e.g., via the web-based console) and explicitly open the ports for the services you need. For example, to allow incoming HTTP traffic, you would run a command like:
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent

8,Conceptual,"What does it mean for Chameleon to support ""deep reconfigurability""?","""Deep reconfigurability"" is the core design principle of the Chameleon testbed. It means giving researchers an unparalleled level of control over the entire software stack on physical, non-virtualized hardware. This is achieved through several key features:   

Bare Metal Access: Researchers are given exclusive access to entire physical servers, ensuring that experiments are free from the performance interference (""noise"") that can occur in shared or virtualized environments.   

Full Administrative Privileges: Users have root (sudo) access on their reserved nodes. This allows them to install a custom operating system, modify the kernel, change bootloader configurations, and access the machine's serial console.   

This level of control is essential for many areas of computer science systems research where the experiment involves modifying the operating system itself or requires precise, repeatable performance measurements.",model_2_answer,"According to the context, 'deep reconfigurability' refers to the ability to fully control over physical hardware and software stack, enabling reproducible experimental research. This is mentioned in the first paragraph of the documentation: 'Chameleon provides researchers with deeply reconfigurable cloud infrastructure for systems, networking, distributed computing, and security research.'

9,Comparative,What is the difference between a Floating IP and a Private IP?,"On Chameleon, Private IPs and Floating IPs serve distinct networking purposes :   

Private IP (Fixed IP): This is an IP address assigned to an instance for communication within Chameleon's internal network (e.g., sharednet1). It is not directly reachable from the public internet. Instances use their private IP to communicate with each other and to initiate outbound connections to the internet through a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway.   

Floating IP: This is a publicly routable IPv4 address that can be dynamically associated with an instance. A Floating IP is required for an instance to be directly accessible from the public internet (for example, to connect via SSH from your laptop or to host a public web server). Floating IPs are a limited, shared resource, so users are encouraged to release them when they are no longer needed. ",model_2_answer,"A Floating IP is a publicly accessible IP address associated with an instance, allowing external connections to the instance. On the other hand, a Private IP is not publicly accessible and is used for communication between instances within the same project.

10,Comparative,When should I use an FPGA node versus a GPU node?,"While the Chameleon documentation does not provide a direct comparison, the choice between an FPGA and a GPU depends on the specific requirements of your research, based on the fundamental differences in their architectures :   

Use a GPU Node for: High-throughput, data-parallel computations. GPUs contain thousands of cores optimized for performing the same operation on large amounts of data simultaneously. This makes them exceptionally well-suited for the matrix and vector operations that dominate deep learning model training and inference, scientific simulations, and high-performance computing (HPC).   

Use an FPGA Node for: Latency-critical or power-sensitive applications requiring custom hardware logic. An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is a fabric of reconfigurable logic blocks, not a fixed set of cores. This allows you to design and implement a custom digital circuit optimized for a specific algorithm. FPGAs can offer advantages in low-latency processing (e.g., network packet processing, real-time signal processing), power efficiency, and for prototyping novel hardware accelerators before committing to a final chip design (ASIC).",model_2_answer,"You should use an FPGA node when: You need a custom hardware acceleration for specific tasks such as AI, machine learning, or data processing. You require low latency and high throughput for applications like networking, security, or scientific simulations.

14,Negative Question,Can I use my Chameleon allocation to mine cryptocurrency?,"No, you cannot. Chameleon's Acceptable Use Policy explicitly prohibits running applications that mine cryptocurrency or use blockchain technology for personal financial gain.   

As a publicly funded research instrument supported by the National Science Foundation, Chameleon resources must be used exclusively for research and educational work. Cryptocurrency mining is considered a commercial or personal-gain activity that consumes significant resources and is therefore outside the testbed's mission. An exception may be granted for legitimate    

research into blockchain technology, but this requires advance, explicit approval from the Chameleon team.",model_2_answer,"You cannot use your Chameleon allocation to mine cryptocurrency.

15,Complex Query,How can I set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node?,"Chameleon's support for ""deep reconfigurability"" allows you to install and boot from a custom kernel on a bare metal node. The general process is as follows :   

Launch an Instance: Start by launching an instance from a ""whole disk image."" Most of the standard Chameleon-provided OS images (e.g., CC-Ubuntu20.04) are whole disk images suitable for this purpose.

Install Your Kernel: Once the instance is running, connect to it via SSH. Transfer your custom kernel and its associated modules to the instance and install them.

Modify the Bootloader: With root privileges, edit the bootloader configuration file (e.g., /boot/grub2/grub.cfg). Add a new menu entry that points to your new kernel and ramdisk files. You can also specify any custom kernel command-line parameters in this entry.

Reboot: Reboot the node. It will now boot using your specified custom kernel.

Note that for the cc-snapshot tool to work correctly with your custom environment, the size of your kernel's modules directory (/lib/modules/<kernel_version>) must be less than 4GB. ",model_2_answer,"To set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node, you can use the ssh module in Chameleon's API. Specifically, you can use the Remote class to connect to your instance and run a script that sets up the kernel version. Here is an example code snippet:
from chi import ssh
with ssh.Remote(floating_ip) as conn:

17,How-To,How do I launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates?,"You can automate the deployment of complex, multi-node topologies using OpenStack's Heat orchestration service. The process uses a declarative YAML file called a Heat Orchestration Template (HOT).   

Here is the workflow to launch a multi-node ""stack"" :   

Create a Reservation: First, you must have an active lease with enough nodes to accommodate your entire deployment (e.g., if your template defines 1 server and 3 clients, you need a reservation for at least 4 nodes).

Navigate to Orchestration: In the Chameleon dashboard, go to Project > Orchestration > Stacks.

Launch Stack: Click the Launch Stack button.

Select Template: Specify your Heat template. You can upload the YAML file, paste its contents directly, or provide a URL to a template hosted online.

Enter Parameters: The interface will prompt you to enter values for any parameters defined in the template. This will always include a name for the stack, your password, the ID of your reservation, and an SSH key. It may also include custom parameters, like the number of client nodes to create.

Launch: Click Launch. Heat will then automatically provision all the resources—instances, networks, routers, etc.—as defined in your template.",model_2_answer,"To launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates, you need to create a Complex Appliance document (template) that contains the information needed to orchestrate the deployment and configuration of your cluster.

19,Troubleshooting,"Why can't my instance access the internet, even with a floating IP?","The most common reason an instance with a floating IP cannot be accessed from the internet is due to the host-based firewall running on the instance itself.   

Chameleon's supported operating system images (like Ubuntu and CentOS) are pre-configured with firewalld enabled by default for security. This firewall has restrictive rules that block most incoming connections from the public internet.   

To solve this, you must connect to your instance (e.g., via the web-based console) and explicitly open the ports for the services you need. For example, to allow incoming HTTP traffic, you would run a command like:
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
Followed by:

Launch the Jupyter Notebook: From the Trovi page, you can launch the artifact directly into Chameleon's Jupyter environment.

Execute the Notebook: The notebook will contain executable code cells that use Chameleon's Python library (python-chi) to programmatically handle the entire experimental lifecycle. This includes reserving the correct type of hardware, launching instances from the specific custom image, configuring the required networking (e.g., isolated VLANs), running the experiment, and collecting the results.

6,Troubleshooting,"I get an ""Error 403: Forbidden"" when trying to use the OpenStack CLI. What's wrong?","An ""Error 403: Forbidden"" when using the OpenStack command-line interface (CLI) is most commonly caused by missing or improperly sourced credentials.   

To use the CLI, you must first authenticate your session. This is done by sourcing an OpenStack RC script (often called a novarc file) in your terminal. This file contains the necessary environment variables (like your username, password, project ID, and authentication URL) that the CLI tools need to communicate with the Chameleon API.

Solution: Ensure you have downloaded your project's OpenStack RC script from the Chameleon dashboard and have sourced it correctly in your terminal session (e.g., by running source your-project-openrc.sh) before executing any other commands.",model_3_answer,"The error 'Error 403: Forbidden' when using the OpenStack CLI is not mentioned in the provided context.

8,Conceptual,"What does it mean for Chameleon to support ""deep reconfigurability""?","""Deep reconfigurability"" is the core design principle of the Chameleon testbed. It means giving researchers an unparalleled level of control over the entire software stack on physical, non-virtualized hardware. This is achieved through several key features:   

Bare Metal Access: Researchers are given exclusive access to entire physical servers, ensuring that experiments are free from the performance interference (""noise"") that can occur in shared or virtualized environments.   

Full Administrative Privileges: Users have root (sudo) access on their reserved nodes. This allows them to install a custom operating system, modify the kernel, change bootloader configurations, and access the machine's serial console.   

This level of control is essential for many areas of computer science systems research where the experiment involves modifying the operating system itself or requires precise, repeatable performance measurements.",model_3_answer,"According to the context, 'deep reconfigurability' refers to Chameleon's ability to provide researchers with deeply reconfigurable cloud infrastructure for systems, networking, distributed computing, and security research. This means that users can customize their experimental setup by requesting specific hardware configurations, which will be fulfilled by the Chameleon team.

9,Comparative,What is the difference between a Floating IP and a Private IP?,"On Chameleon, Private IPs and Floating IPs serve distinct networking purposes :   

Private IP (Fixed IP): This is an IP address assigned to an instance for communication within Chameleon's internal network (e.g., sharednet1). It is not directly reachable from the public internet. Instances use their private IP to communicate with each other and to initiate outbound connections to the internet through a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway.   

Floating IP: This is a publicly routable IPv4 address that can be dynamically associated with an instance. A Floating IP is required for an instance to be directly accessible from the public internet (for example, to connect via SSH from your laptop or to host a public web server). Floating IPs are a limited, shared resource, so users are encouraged to release them when they are no longer needed. ",model_3_answer,"A Floating IP is a publicly accessible IP address associated with an instance in Chameleon Cloud, allowing it to be accessed from outside the testbed. On the other hand, a Private IP is used for communication between instances within the same project and site.

10,Comparative,When should I use an FPGA node versus a GPU node?,"While the Chameleon documentation does not provide a direct comparison, the choice between an FPGA and a GPU depends on the specific requirements of your research, based on the fundamental differences in their architectures :   

Use a GPU Node for: High-throughput, data-parallel computations. GPUs contain thousands of cores optimized for performing the same operation on large amounts of data simultaneously. This makes them exceptionally well-suited for the matrix and vector operations that dominate deep learning model training and inference, scientific simulations, and high-performance computing (HPC).   

Use an FPGA Node for: Latency-critical or power-sensitive applications requiring custom hardware logic. An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is a fabric of reconfigurable logic blocks, not a fixed set of cores. This allows you to design and implement a custom digital circuit optimized for a specific algorithm. FPGAs can offer advantages in low-latency processing (e.g., network packet processing, real-time signal processing), power efficiency, and for prototyping novel hardware accelerators before committing to a final chip design (ASIC).",model_3_answer,"You should use an FPGA node versus a GPU node when you need high-performance computing capabilities for tasks such as data processing, machine learning, or scientific simulations that require custom hardware acceleration.

14,Negative Question,Can I use my Chameleon allocation to mine cryptocurrency?,"No, you cannot. Chameleon's Acceptable Use Policy explicitly prohibits running applications that mine cryptocurrency or use blockchain technology for personal financial gain.   

As a publicly funded research instrument supported by the National Science Foundation, Chameleon resources must be used exclusively for research and educational work. Cryptocurrency mining is considered a commercial or personal-gain activity that consumes significant resources and is therefore outside the testbed's mission. An exception may be granted for legitimate    

research into blockchain technology, but this requires advance, explicit approval from the Chameleon team.",model_3_answer,"You cannot use your Chameleon allocation to mine cryptocurrency. According to the documentation, 'Resources are allocated and charged in Service Units (SUs) which equate to one hour of wall clock time on a base bare metal server.'

15,Complex Query,How can I set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node?,"Chameleon's support for ""deep reconfigurability"" allows you to install and boot from a custom kernel on a bare metal node. The general process is as follows :   

Launch an Instance: Start by launching an instance from a ""whole disk image."" Most of the standard Chameleon-provided OS images (e.g., CC-Ubuntu20.04) are whole disk images suitable for this purpose.

Install Your Kernel: Once the instance is running, connect to it via SSH. Transfer your custom kernel and its associated modules to the instance and install them.

Modify the Bootloader: With root privileges, edit the bootloader configuration file (e.g., /boot/grub2/grub.cfg). Add a new menu entry that points to your new kernel and ramdisk files. You can also specify any custom kernel command-line parameters in this entry.

Reboot: Reboot the node. It will now boot using your specified custom kernel.

Note that for the cc-snapshot tool to work correctly with your custom environment, the size of your kernel's modules directory (/lib/modules/<kernel_version>) must be less than 4GB. ",model_3_answer,"To set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node, you can follow these steps: Create a custom image with the desired kernel version using CC-Images tool or OpenStack Diskimage-builder.

17,How-To,How do I launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates?,"You can automate the deployment of complex, multi-node topologies using OpenStack's Heat orchestration service. The process uses a declarative YAML file called a Heat Orchestration Template (HOT).   

Here is the workflow to launch a multi-node ""stack"" :   

Create a Reservation: First, you must have an active lease with enough nodes to accommodate your entire deployment (e.g., if your template defines 1 server and 3 clients, you need a reservation for at least 4 nodes).

Navigate to Orchestration: In the Chameleon dashboard, go to Project > Orchestration > Stacks.

Launch Stack: Click the Launch Stack button.

Select Template: Specify your Heat template. You can upload the YAML file, paste its contents directly, or provide a URL to a template hosted online.

Enter Parameters: The interface will prompt you to enter values for any parameters defined in the template. This will always include a name for the stack, your password, the ID of your reservation, and an SSH key. It may also include custom parameters, like the number of client nodes to create.

Launch: Click Launch. Heat will then automatically provision all the resources—instances, networks, routers, etc.—as defined in your template.",model_3_answer,"To launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates, you can use the OpenStack Heat orchestration service. According to the context, Complex Appliances in Chameleon are currently implemented using OpenStack Heat.

19,Troubleshooting,"Why can't my instance access the internet, even with a floating IP?","The most common reason an instance with a floating IP cannot be accessed from the internet is due to the host-based firewall running on the instance itself.   

Chameleon's supported operating system images (like Ubuntu and CentOS) are pre-configured with firewalld enabled by default for security. This firewall has restrictive rules that block most incoming connections from the public internet.   

To solve this, you must connect to your instance (e.g., via the web-based console) and explicitly open the ports for the services you need. For example, to allow incoming HTTP traffic, you would run a command like:

Launch the Jupyter Notebook: From the Trovi page, you can launch the artifact directly into Chameleon's Jupyter environment.

Execute the Notebook: The notebook will contain executable code cells that use Chameleon's Python library (python-chi) to programmatically handle the entire experimental lifecycle. This includes reserving the correct type of hardware, launching instances from the specific custom image, configuring the required networking (e.g., isolated VLANs), running the experiment, and collecting the results.

8,Conceptual,"What does it mean for Chameleon to support ""deep reconfigurability""?","""Deep reconfigurability"" is the core design principle of the Chameleon testbed. It means giving researchers an unparalleled level of control over the entire software stack on physical, non-virtualized hardware. This is achieved through several key features:   

Bare Metal Access: Researchers are given exclusive access to entire physical servers, ensuring that experiments are free from the performance interference (""noise"") that can occur in shared or virtualized environments.   

Full Administrative Privileges: Users have root (sudo) access on their reserved nodes. This allows them to install a custom operating system, modify the kernel, change bootloader configurations, and access the machine's serial console.

9,Comparative,What is the difference between a Floating IP and a Private IP?,"On Chameleon, Private IPs and Floating IPs serve distinct networking purposes :   

Private IP (Fixed IP): This is an IP address assigned to an instance for communication within Chameleon's internal network (e.g., sharednet1). It is not directly reachable from the public internet. Instances use their private IP to communicate with each other and to initiate outbound connections to the internet through a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway.   

Floating IP: This is a publicly routable IPv4 address that can be dynamically associated with an instance. A Floating IP is required for an instance to be directly accessible from the public internet (for example, to connect via SSH from your laptop or to host a public web server). Floating IPs are a limited, shared resource, so users are encouraged to release them when they are no longer needed. ",model_4_answer,"A Floating IP is a publicly accessible IP address that allows access to your instance over the public Internet, while a Private IP is an internal IP address used for communication within the Chameleon network.

10,Comparative,When should I use an FPGA node versus a GPU node?,"While the Chameleon documentation does not provide a direct comparison, the choice between an FPGA and a GPU depends on the specific requirements of your research, based on the fundamental differences in their architectures :   

Use a GPU Node for: High-throughput, data-parallel computations. GPUs contain thousands of cores optimized for performing the same operation on large amounts of data simultaneously. This makes them exceptionally well-suited for the matrix and vector operations that dominate deep learning model training and inference, scientific simulations, and high-performance computing (HPC).   

Use an FPGA Node for: Latency-critical or power-sensitive applications requiring custom hardware logic. An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is a fabric of reconfigurable logic blocks, not a fixed set of cores. This allows you to design and implement a custom digital circuit optimized for a specific algorithm. FPGAs can offer advantages in low-latency processing (e.g., network packet processing, real-time signal processing), power efficiency, and for prototyping novel hardware accelerators before committing to a final chip design (ASIC).",model_4_answer,"To answer your question, you should use an FPGA node versus a GPU node when: You need high-performance computing for tasks that require low latency and high throughput, such as data processing, machine learning, or scientific simulations.

15,Complex Query,How can I set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node?,"Chameleon's support for ""deep reconfigurability"" allows you to install and boot from a custom kernel on a bare metal node. The general process is as follows :   

Launch an Instance: Start by launching an instance from a ""whole disk image."" Most of the standard Chameleon-provided OS images (e.g., CC-Ubuntu20.04) are whole disk images suitable for this purpose.

Install Your Kernel: Once the instance is running, connect to it via SSH. Transfer your custom kernel and its associated modules to the instance and install them.

Modify the Bootloader: With root privileges, edit the bootloader configuration file (e.g., /boot/grub2/grub.cfg). Add a new menu entry that points to your new kernel and ramdisk files. You can also specify any custom kernel command-line parameters in this entry.

Reboot: Reboot the node. It will now boot using your specified custom kernel.

17,How-To,How do I launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates?,"You can automate the deployment of complex, multi-node topologies using OpenStack's Heat orchestration service. The process uses a declarative YAML file called a Heat Orchestration Template (HOT).   

Here is the workflow to launch a multi-node ""stack"" :   

Create a Reservation: First, you must have an active lease with enough nodes to accommodate your entire deployment (e.g., if your template defines 1 server and 3 clients, you need a reservation for at least 4 nodes).

Navigate to Orchestration: In the Chameleon dashboard, go to Project > Orchestration > Stacks.

Launch Stack: Click the Launch Stack button.

Select Template: Specify your Heat template. You can upload the YAML file, paste its contents directly, or provide a URL to a template hosted online.

Enter Parameters: The interface will prompt you to enter values for any parameters defined in the template. This will always include a name for the stack, your password, the ID of your reservation, and an SSH key. It may also include custom parameters, like the number of client nodes to create.

Launch: Click Launch. Heat will then automatically provision all the resources—instances, networks, routers, etc.—as defined in your template.",model_4_answer,"To launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates, you can follow these steps: Create a new instance in the Instances Dashboard. In the 'Details' section, select the reservation that you want to use for your instances. In the 'Source' section, select the image source (e.g., CC-Ubuntu20.04) and click on the up arrow icon next to it. In the 'Networks' section, allocate a network (e.g., sharednet1). In the 'Key Pairs' section, add a key pair to the instance.
To launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates, you can use the OpenStack Heat API. You will need to create a template file that defines your instances and their configuration. Then, you can use the heat stack-create command to deploy your instances. Here is an example of how to create a Heat template for launching multiple nodes: heat_template_version: 2013-05-23 description: Launch multiple nodes with one command parameters:  ImageName: type: string description: The name of the image to use Flavor: type: string description: The flavor to use for each node NumNodes: type: integer description: The number of nodes to launch resources: Node1: type: OS::Nova::Server properties:  image: { get_param: ImageName }  flavor: { get_param: Flavor } networks: - { name: sharednet1 }  Node2: type: OS::Nova::Server properties:  image: { get_param: ImageName } flavor: { get_param: Flavor } networks: - { name: sharednet1 } This template defines two nodes (Node1 and Node2) with the same configuration. You can add more nodes by duplicating this resource definition. To launch multiple nodes with one command, you can use the heat stack-create command like this:
heat stack-create -f my_template.yaml --parameter ImageName=CC-Ubuntu20.04 --parameter Flavor=m1.xlarge --parameter NumNodes=5 This will deploy five instances with the specified configuration. Note: This is just an example, and you should adjust the template to fit your specific needs.

19,Troubleshooting,"Why can't my instance access the internet, even with a floating IP?","The most common reason an instance with a floating IP cannot be accessed from the internet is due to the host-based firewall running on the instance itself.   

Chameleon's supported operating system images (like Ubuntu and CentOS) are pre-configured with firewalld enabled by default for security. This firewall has restrictive rules that block most incoming connections from the public internet.   

To solve this, you must connect to your instance (e.g., via the web-based console) and explicitly open the ports for the services you need. For example, to allow incoming HTTP traffic, you would run a command like:
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
Followed by:

6,Troubleshooting,"I get an ""Error 403: Forbidden"" when trying to use the OpenStack CLI. What's wrong?","An ""Error 403: Forbidden"" when using the OpenStack command-line interface (CLI) is most commonly caused by missing or improperly sourced credentials.   

To use the CLI, you must first authenticate your session. This is done by sourcing an OpenStack RC script (often called a novarc file) in your terminal. This file contains the necessary environment variables (like your username, password, project ID, and authentication URL) that the CLI tools need to communicate with the Chameleon API.

Solution: Ensure you have downloaded your project's OpenStack RC script from the Chameleon dashboard and have sourced it correctly in your terminal session (e.g., by running source your-project-openrc.sh) before executing any other commands.",model_5_answer,"The error 'Error 403: Forbidden' when using the OpenStack CLI is not mentioned in the provided context.

8,Conceptual,"What does it mean for Chameleon to support ""deep reconfigurability""?","""Deep reconfigurability"" is the core design principle of the Chameleon testbed. It means giving researchers an unparalleled level of control over the entire software stack on physical, non-virtualized hardware. This is achieved through several key features:   

Bare Metal Access: Researchers are given exclusive access to entire physical servers, ensuring that experiments are free from the performance interference (""noise"") that can occur in shared or virtualized environments.   

Full Administrative Privileges: Users have root (sudo) access on their reserved nodes. This allows them to install a custom operating system, modify the kernel, change bootloader configurations, and access the machine's serial console.   

This level of control is essential for many areas of computer science systems research where the experiment involves modifying the operating system itself or requires precise, repeatable performance measurements.",model_5_answer,"According to the context, 'deep reconfigurability' refers to Chameleon's ability to provide researchers with deeply reconfigurable cloud infrastructure for systems, networking, distributed computing, and security research. This means that users can customize their experimental setup by requesting specific hardware configurations, which will be fulfilled by the Chameleon team.

9,Comparative,What is the difference between a Floating IP and a Private IP?,"On Chameleon, Private IPs and Floating IPs serve distinct networking purposes :   

Private IP (Fixed IP): This is an IP address assigned to an instance for communication within Chameleon's internal network (e.g., sharednet1). It is not directly reachable from the public internet. Instances use their private IP to communicate with each other and to initiate outbound connections to the internet through a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway.   

Floating IP: This is a publicly routable IPv4 address that can be dynamically associated with an instance. A Floating IP is required for an instance to be directly accessible from the public internet (for example, to connect via SSH from your laptop or to host a public web server). Floating IPs are a limited, shared resource, so users are encouraged to release them when they are no longer needed. ",model_5_answer,"A Floating IP is a publicly accessible IP address associated with an instance in Chameleon Cloud, allowing it to be accessed from outside the testbed. On the other hand, a Private IP is used for communication between instances within the same project and site.

10,Comparative,When should I use an FPGA node versus a GPU node?,"While the Chameleon documentation does not provide a direct comparison, the choice between an FPGA and a GPU depends on the specific requirements of your research, based on the fundamental differences in their architectures :   

Use a GPU Node for: High-throughput, data-parallel computations. GPUs contain thousands of cores optimized for performing the same operation on large amounts of data simultaneously. This makes them exceptionally well-suited for the matrix and vector operations that dominate deep learning model training and inference, scientific simulations, and high-performance computing (HPC).   

Use an FPGA Node for: Latency-critical or power-sensitive applications requiring custom hardware logic. An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is a fabric of reconfigurable logic blocks, not a fixed set of cores. This allows you to design and implement a custom digital circuit optimized for a specific algorithm. FPGAs can offer advantages in low-latency processing (e.g., network packet processing, real-time signal processing), power efficiency, and for prototyping novel hardware accelerators before committing to a final chip design (ASIC).",model_5_answer,"You should use an FPGA node versus a GPU node when you need high-performance computing capabilities for tasks such as data processing, machine learning, or scientific simulations that require custom hardware acceleration.

13,Factual Recall,What is the maximum duration for a single lease reservation?,"The standard maximum duration for a single lease reservation that can be created through the web interface is seven days.   

However, there is some flexibility. You can extend an active lease for another seven days as long as you do so within 48 hours of its expiration and no other user has already reserved the hardware for that time.

14,Negative Question,Can I use my Chameleon allocation to mine cryptocurrency?,"No, you cannot. Chameleon's Acceptable Use Policy explicitly prohibits running applications that mine cryptocurrency or use blockchain technology for personal financial gain.   

As a publicly funded research instrument supported by the National Science Foundation, Chameleon resources must be used exclusively for research and educational work. Cryptocurrency mining is considered a commercial or personal-gain activity that consumes significant resources and is therefore outside the testbed's mission. An exception may be granted for legitimate    

research into blockchain technology, but this requires advance, explicit approval from the Chameleon team.",model_5_answer,"You cannot use your Chameleon allocation to mine cryptocurrency. According to the documentation, 'Resources are allocated and charged in Service Units (SUs) which equate to one hour of wall clock time on a base bare metal server.'

15,Complex Query,How can I set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node?,"Chameleon's support for ""deep reconfigurability"" allows you to install and boot from a custom kernel on a bare metal node. The general process is as follows :   

Launch an Instance: Start by launching an instance from a ""whole disk image."" Most of the standard Chameleon-provided OS images (e.g., CC-Ubuntu20.04) are whole disk images suitable for this purpose.

Install Your Kernel: Once the instance is running, connect to it via SSH. Transfer your custom kernel and its associated modules to the instance and install them.

Modify the Bootloader: With root privileges, edit the bootloader configuration file (e.g., /boot/grub2/grub.cfg). Add a new menu entry that points to your new kernel and ramdisk files. You can also specify any custom kernel command-line parameters in this entry.

Reboot: Reboot the node. It will now boot using your specified custom kernel.

Note that for the cc-snapshot tool to work correctly with your custom environment, the size of your kernel's modules directory (/lib/modules/<kernel_version>) must be less than 4GB. ",model_5_answer,"To set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node, you can follow these steps: Create a custom image with the desired kernel version using CC-Images tool or OpenStack Diskimage-builder.

17,How-To,How do I launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates?,"You can automate the deployment of complex, multi-node topologies using OpenStack's Heat orchestration service. The process uses a declarative YAML file called a Heat Orchestration Template (HOT).   

Here is the workflow to launch a multi-node ""stack"" :   

Create a Reservation: First, you must have an active lease with enough nodes to accommodate your entire deployment (e.g., if your template defines 1 server and 3 clients, you need a reservation for at least 4 nodes).

Navigate to Orchestration: In the Chameleon dashboard, go to Project > Orchestration > Stacks.

Launch Stack: Click the Launch Stack button.

Select Template: Specify your Heat template. You can upload the YAML file, paste its contents directly, or provide a URL to a template hosted online.

Enter Parameters: The interface will prompt you to enter values for any parameters defined in the template. This will always include a name for the stack, your password, the ID of your reservation, and an SSH key. It may also include custom parameters, like the number of client nodes to create.

Launch: Click Launch. Heat will then automatically provision all the resources—instances, networks, routers, etc.—as defined in your template.",model_5_answer,"To launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates, you can use the OpenStack Heat orchestration service. According to the context, Complex Appliances in Chameleon are currently implemented using OpenStack Heat. You can create a YAML file using the Heat Orchestration Template (HOT) that defines your deployment and configuration.

19,Troubleshooting,"Why can't my instance access the internet, even with a floating IP?","The most common reason an instance with a floating IP cannot be accessed from the internet is due to the host-based firewall running on the instance itself.   

Chameleon's supported operating system images (like Ubuntu and CentOS) are pre-configured with firewalld enabled by default for security. This firewall has restrictive rules that block most incoming connections from the public internet.   

To solve this, you must connect to your instance (e.g., via the web-based console) and explicitly open the ports for the services you need. For example, to allow incoming HTTP traffic, you would run a command like:
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent

Launch the Jupyter Notebook: From the Trovi page, you can launch the artifact directly into Chameleon's Jupyter environment.

Execute the Notebook: The notebook will contain executable code cells that use Chameleon's Python library (python-chi) to programmatically handle the entire experimental lifecycle. This includes reserving the correct type of hardware, launching instances from the specific custom image, configuring the required networking (e.g., isolated VLANs), running the experiment, and collecting the results.

1,Factual Recall,What is the purpose of the Chameleon Associate Sites?,"Chameleon Associate Sites are independently-owned and operated hardware resources at other institutions that are integrated into the main Chameleon testbed. Their purpose is twofold:   

For the Chameleon Community: They expand the testbed's scale and hardware diversity, offering unique capabilities not available at the core sites. For example, the site at Northwestern University (CHI@NU) provides nodes with 100G NICs for advanced networking experiments. These resources are available to all Chameleon users through the federated login system.   

For the Host Institution: They provide a turnkey solution for institutions to establish their own research cloud without the high cost and operational overhead of developing the infrastructure from scratch. The central Chameleon team handles user support, system upgrades, and provides a suite of operational tools, allowing the host institution to focus on managing its physical hardware.

5,Troubleshooting,"My bare metal node is stuck in the ""deploying"" state for a long time. What should I do?","If a bare metal node remains in the ""deploying"" state for an extended period, it may be experiencing an issue during the boot or provisioning process. The recommended course of action is :   

Wait: The deployment process for a physical node can sometimes take several minutes. It is advisable to wait at least 10-15 minutes to see if the process completes on its own.

Contact Support: If the node is still stuck after this waiting period, you should open a ticket with the Chameleon Help Desk. The operations team can investigate the underlying cause of the deployment failure and resolve the issue. ",model_6_answer,"Your bare metal node is stuck in the 'deploying' state for a long time.

8,Conceptual,"What does it mean for Chameleon to support ""deep reconfigurability""?","""Deep reconfigurability"" is the core design principle of the Chameleon testbed. It means giving researchers an unparalleled level of control over the entire software stack on physical, non-virtualized hardware. This is achieved through several key features:   

Bare Metal Access: Researchers are given exclusive access to entire physical servers, ensuring that experiments are free from the performance interference (""noise"") that can occur in shared or virtualized environments.   

Full Administrative Privileges: Users have root (sudo) access on their reserved nodes. This allows them to install a custom operating system, modify the kernel, change bootloader configurations, and access the machine's serial console.   

This level of control is essential for many areas of computer science systems research where the experiment involves modifying the operating system itself or requires precise, repeatable performance measurements.",model_6_answer,"According to the context, 'deep reconfigurability' refers to the ability of Chameleon to provide researchers with deeply reconfigurable cloud infrastructure for systems, networking, distributed computing, and security research.

9,Comparative,What is the difference between a Floating IP and a Private IP?,"On Chameleon, Private IPs and Floating IPs serve distinct networking purposes :   

Private IP (Fixed IP): This is an IP address assigned to an instance for communication within Chameleon's internal network (e.g., sharednet1). It is not directly reachable from the public internet. Instances use their private IP to communicate with each other and to initiate outbound connections to the internet through a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway.   

Floating IP: This is a publicly routable IPv4 address that can be dynamically associated with an instance. A Floating IP is required for an instance to be directly accessible from the public internet (for example, to connect via SSH from your laptop or to host a public web server). Floating IPs are a limited, shared resource, so users are encouraged to release them when they are no longer needed. ",model_6_answer,"A Floating IP is a publicly accessible IP address assigned to an instance, allowing access over the public Internet. A Private IP, on the other hand, is a private IP address that is not accessible from outside the Chameleon network. This information comes from the 'I can't ping or SSH to my instance, what are some good things to try?' section and here is the link to the site: https://docs.chameleoncloud.org/en/latest/user/quickstart.html#i-cant-ping-or-ssh-to-my-instance-what-are-some-good-things-to-try",0.2597402597402597,0.7572219967842102,0.19402985074626866,0.5457924242321724
10,Comparative,When should I use an FPGA node versus a GPU node?,"While the Chameleon documentation does not provide a direct comparison, the choice between an FPGA and a GPU depends on the specific requirements of your research, based on the fundamental differences in their architectures :   

Use a GPU Node for: High-throughput, data-parallel computations. GPUs contain thousands of cores optimized for performing the same operation on large amounts of data simultaneously. This makes them exceptionally well-suited for the matrix and vector operations that dominate deep learning model training and inference, scientific simulations, and high-performance computing (HPC).   

Use an FPGA Node for: Latency-critical or power-sensitive applications requiring custom hardware logic. An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is a fabric of reconfigurable logic blocks, not a fixed set of cores. This allows you to design and implement a custom digital circuit optimized for a specific algorithm. FPGAs can offer advantages in low-latency processing (e.g., network packet processing, real-time signal processing), power efficiency, and for prototyping novel hardware accelerators before committing to a final chip design (ASIC).",model_6_answer,"When deciding between an FPGA node and a GPU node, consider the following: FPGA nodes are suitable for applications that require high-speed data processing, low latency, and custom hardware acceleration. They are ideal for tasks such as machine learning inference, signal processing, and cryptographic operations. GPU nodes, on the other hand, are better suited for general-purpose computing, data analytics, and deep learning workloads.

15,Complex Query,How can I set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node?,"Chameleon's support for ""deep reconfigurability"" allows you to install and boot from a custom kernel on a bare metal node. The general process is as follows :   

Launch an Instance: Start by launching an instance from a ""whole disk image."" Most of the standard Chameleon-provided OS images (e.g., CC-Ubuntu20.04) are whole disk images suitable for this purpose.

Install Your Kernel: Once the instance is running, connect to it via SSH. Transfer your custom kernel and its associated modules to the instance and install them.

Modify the Bootloader: With root privileges, edit the bootloader configuration file (e.g., /boot/grub2/grub.cfg). Add a new menu entry that points to your new kernel and ramdisk files. You can also specify any custom kernel command-line parameters in this entry.

Reboot: Reboot the node. It will now boot using your specified custom kernel.

17,How-To,How do I launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates?,"You can automate the deployment of complex, multi-node topologies using OpenStack's Heat orchestration service. The process uses a declarative YAML file called a Heat Orchestration Template (HOT).   

Here is the workflow to launch a multi-node ""stack"" :   

Create a Reservation: First, you must have an active lease with enough nodes to accommodate your entire deployment (e.g., if your template defines 1 server and 3 clients, you need a reservation for at least 4 nodes).

Navigate to Orchestration: In the Chameleon dashboard, go to Project > Orchestration > Stacks.

Launch Stack: Click the Launch Stack button.

Select Template: Specify your Heat template. You can upload the YAML file, paste its contents directly, or provide a URL to a template hosted online.

19,Troubleshooting,"Why can't my instance access the internet, even with a floating IP?","The most common reason an instance with a floating IP cannot be accessed from the internet is due to the host-based firewall running on the instance itself.   

Chameleon's supported operating system images (like Ubuntu and CentOS) are pre-configured with firewalld enabled by default for security. This firewall has restrictive rules that block most incoming connections from the public internet.   

To solve this, you must connect to your instance (e.g., via the web-based console) and explicitly open the ports for the services you need. For example, to allow incoming HTTP traffic, you would run a command like:
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent

Launch the Jupyter Notebook: From the Trovi page, you can launch the artifact directly into Chameleon's Jupyter environment.

Execute the Notebook: The notebook will contain executable code cells that use Chameleon's Python library (python-chi) to programmatically handle the entire experimental lifecycle. This includes reserving the correct type of hardware, launching instances from the specific custom image, configuring the required networking (e.g., isolated VLANs), running the experiment, and collecting the results.

3,How-To,How do I create an isolated network for my instances using the GUI?,"You can create an isolated network, which functions as a private Layer-2 VLAN, through the Chameleon web dashboard. This allows you to run your own network services, like DHCP, without interfering with other users. Here is the step-by-step process :   

Create the Network and Subnet:

Navigate to the Network > Networks page and click the +Create Network button.

In the wizard, give your network a name.

On the Subnet tab, provide a name for the subnet and define its private IP address range in CIDR notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).

On the Subnet Details tab, you can optionally configure DHCP allocation pools and specify DNS servers. Click Create to finish.

Create a Router:

Navigate to the Network > Routers page and click +Create Router.

Give the router a name and click Create Router.

Connect the Router to the Subnet:

On the Routers page, find your new router and click on its name.

Go to the Interfaces tab and click Add Interface.

In the dialog, select the subnet you created in the first step and click Submit.

Leave DNS nameservers blank or enter custom ones if needed (e.g., 8.8.8.8). Click Create. 4. (Optional) Add a router for external connectivity
If you want the network to have internet access: Go to Network → Routers → Create Router. Name the router and set the External Network (often named public or similar). After creating it, click the router name, go to the Interfaces tab, and Add Interface to your subnet.
If you want true isolation (no outside connectivity), skip this step.
5. Launch instances on the new network When launching an instance, under the Networks tab, select your isolated network. Make sure you don’t attach a public network or router if you want full isolation.",0.31947483588621445,0.8375829458236694,0.2540983606557377,0.6828591565646662
4,How-To,How do I find and use a pre-configured Jupyter notebook on Chameleon?,"You can find and use pre-configured Jupyter notebooks through Trovi, Chameleon's sharing portal for reproducible experiments.   

Find the Notebook: Navigate to the Trovi portal by selecting ""Trovi"" from the ""Experiment"" dropdown menu on the main Chameleon website. Here you will see a catalog of public ""artifacts,"" which are packaged experiments often containing Jupyter notebooks, scripts, and documentation.   

Use the Notebook: Once you find an artifact you want to use, click the ""Launch on Chameleon"" button. This will open the artifact, including its Jupyter notebook, directly within Chameleon's shared JupyterHub environment, which is accessible to all users with an active project allocation. The notebook will contain the code and instructions needed to replicate the experiment.   ",base_openai_model_answer,"Here’s how you can find and use a pre-configured Jupyter notebook on Chameleon Cloud:1. Go to Chameleon’s JupyterHub
Visit: https://jupyter.chameleoncloud.org
Log in with your Chameleon credentials (via Globus or institutional login). 2. Launch a pre-configured environment
After logging in, you’ll see a 'Start My Server' page.
In the Server Options, select a pre-configured environment.
Examples: Python Data Science, HPC, TensorFlow, etc.
These environments already have common packages installed and are set up for Chameleon. Choose your compute site (e.g., CHI@TACC, CHI@UC) and instance type. 3. Access example notebooks
Once the Jupyter environment launches, look for:
A examples/ or notebooks/ folder in your home directory. Or click File → Open… and browse to /examples or /shared. Chameleon provides preloaded example notebooks for things like: OpenStack automation
Networking experiments Machine learning demos Hardware control
4. Run the notebook Open a notebook (.ipynb file) by clicking it.
Run cells with Shift+Enter. You can edit the notebook to fit your experiment. 5. Save your work Save your modified notebook in your home directory so it persists between sessions. You can also download it to your local machine via File → Download As → Notebook (.ipynb).

5,Troubleshooting,"My bare metal node is stuck in the ""deploying"" state for a long time. What should I do?","If a bare metal node remains in the ""deploying"" state for an extended period, it may be experiencing an issue during the boot or provisioning process. The recommended course of action is :   

Wait: The deployment process for a physical node can sometimes take several minutes. It is advisable to wait at least 10-15 minutes to see if the process completes on its own.

Contact Support: If the node is still stuck after this waiting period, you should open a ticket with the Chameleon Help Desk. The operations team can investigate the underlying cause of the deployment failure and resolve the issue. ",base_openai_model_answer,"If your bare metal node on Chameleon is stuck in ""deploying"" for much longer than usual, here’s the recommended approach: 1. Wait the normal window Bare metal provisioning typically takes 5–15 minutes, sometimes up to 30 minutes for large images. If it’s been over 30–45 minutes, it’s likely stuck. 2. Check the instance logs Go to Project → Compute → Instances in the Horizon GUI. Click your instance name → Log tab.Look for errors related to PXE boot, disk imaging, or network.
3. Try to rebuild the instance In the instance’s Actions menu, select Rebuild. Choose the same image and flavor (or try a smaller image to test). This forces the provisioning process to restart. 4. Delete and re-launch If rebuild doesn’t work: Delete the instance. Wait a few minutes so the node is fully released. Launch it again — preferably on a different node if the scheduler allows. 5. Check resource availability
Sometimes the site is under heavy load or has a faulty node. In the GUI, go to Project → Compute → Bare Metal → Nodes to see the node’s status (if you have permission). 6. Contact Chameleon Support
If it’s still stuck: Open a ticket at https://www.chameleoncloud.org/user/help/ Provide: Instance ID Reservation ID (if using a reserved node)

6,Troubleshooting,"I get an ""Error 403: Forbidden"" when trying to use the OpenStack CLI. What's wrong?","An ""Error 403: Forbidden"" when using the OpenStack command-line interface (CLI) is most commonly caused by missing or improperly sourced credentials.   

To use the CLI, you must first authenticate your session. This is done by sourcing an OpenStack RC script (often called a novarc file) in your terminal. This file contains the necessary environment variables (like your username, password, project ID, and authentication URL) that the CLI tools need to communicate with the Chameleon API.

Solution: Ensure you have downloaded your project's OpenStack RC script from the Chameleon dashboard and have sourced it correctly in your terminal session (e.g., by running source your-project-openrc.sh) before executing any other commands.",base_openai_model_answer,"On Chameleon, an ""Error 403: Forbidden"" when using the OpenStack CLI usually means your CLI is authenticating correctly but you don’t have permission to perform the requested action.
Here’s how to troubleshoot it step-by-step: 1. Check your credentials
Make sure you downloaded the correct OpenRC file for your Chameleon project and site: Go to the Horizon GUI → API Access → Download OpenStack RC File. Source it before running CLI commands:
source ~/Downloads/project-openrc.sh Enter your Chameleon password when prompted. 2. Verify your active project
You may belong to multiple projects; if you’re in the wrong one, you won’t have permissions. Run: openstack token issue
Check the project_id and project_name match your intended project.
3. Confirm your role in the project Only users with the correct role (e.g., admin, member) can run certain commands like creating networks, routers, or security groups. If you need extra permissions, contact your project PI or Chameleon support. 4. Make sure you’re using the right site Chameleon has multiple sites (CHI@TACC, CHI@UC, etc.).
If your OpenRC file points to CHI@UC, you can’t manage resources at CHI@TACC. You must download and source the RC file for the specific site. 5. Check command scope Some commands require admin privileges that are not available to standard users (e.g., listing all hypervisors). If you’re running a command that’s restricted, you’ll get 403. 6. Contact Support if all above is correct If credentials, project, site, and role are all correct, it could be: A temporary policy misconfiguration. A bug in the CLI endpoint. Open a ticket with:
Exact CLI command you ran. Full error output. Site name and project ID.",0.18362282878411912,0.8046300411224365,0.15789473684210525,0.5266455335329405
7,Conceptual,"What is ""CHI-in-a-Box""?","CHI-in-a-Box is a distributable software package that contains the complete, containerized infrastructure stack that powers the Chameleon testbed. It bundles the open-source cloud platform OpenStack with all of the Chameleon-specific customizations and operational tools needed to run a research-oriented cloud.   

These customizations include features not found in a standard OpenStack installation, such as bare metal snapshotting, network stitching for connecting to other testbeds, and advanced hardware reservation capabilities. CHI-in-a-Box is the technology that enables other institutions to set up their own Chameleon Associate Sites, allowing them to join the federated testbed without having to develop their own complex cloud software from scratch",base_openai_model_answer,"CHI-in-a-Box is Chameleon Cloud’s packaged version of its Chameleon Infrastructure (CHI) that you can deploy on your own hardware.

8,Conceptual,"What does it mean for Chameleon to support ""deep reconfigurability""?","""Deep reconfigurability"" is the core design principle of the Chameleon testbed. It means giving researchers an unparalleled level of control over the entire software stack on physical, non-virtualized hardware. This is achieved through several key features:   

Bare Metal Access: Researchers are given exclusive access to entire physical servers, ensuring that experiments are free from the performance interference (""noise"") that can occur in shared or virtualized environments.   

Full Administrative Privileges: Users have root (sudo) access on their reserved nodes. This allows them to install a custom operating system, modify the kernel, change bootloader configurations, and access the machine's serial console.   

This level of control is essential for many areas of computer science systems research where the experiment involves modifying the operating system itself or requires precise, repeatable performance measurements.",base_openai_model_answer,"For Chameleon Cloud, “deep reconfigurability” means that the testbed lets you reconfigure not just software, but also low-level system and hardware components — all the way down to bare metal — so you can run experiments that would be impossible on a standard public cloud.
Key aspects Bare metal access You get full control of a physical node — no hypervisor layer between you and the hardware. Lets you modify BIOS/firmware settings, install custom kernels, or change OS images entirely. Custom networking You can design your own isolated networks, set up software-defined networking (SDN), and control routing/switching for experiments. Specialized hardware control
Access to FPGAs, GPUs, high-speed interconnects, and experimental storage devices — and the ability to reconfigure them. Software stack flexibility You’re free to install custom drivers, OS distributions, libraries, or experimental software without the restrictions typical clouds impose. Why it matters Enables systems research (e.g., new schedulers, storage stacks, or network protocols). Supports hardware–software co-design experiments. Lets researchers test ideas under realistic performance conditions, without virtualization overhead.
In short — deep reconfigurability means Chameleon isn’t just 'cloud servers you can log into.' It’s a testbed where you can reshape the entire stack — hardware through software — to fit your experiment.",0.14836795252225518,0.7976806163787842,0.22388059701492538,0.34600450279642275
9,Comparative,What is the difference between a Floating IP and a Private IP?,"On Chameleon, Private IPs and Floating IPs serve distinct networking purposes :   

Private IP (Fixed IP): This is an IP address assigned to an instance for communication within Chameleon's internal network (e.g., sharednet1). It is not directly reachable from the public internet. Instances use their private IP to communicate with each other and to initiate outbound connections to the internet through a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway.   

Floating IP: This is a publicly routable IPv4 address that can be dynamically associated with an instance. A Floating IP is required for an instance to be directly accessible from the public internet (for example, to connect via SSH from your laptop or to host a public web server). Floating IPs are a limited, shared resource, so users are encouraged to release them when they are no longer needed. ",base_openai_model_answer,"On Chameleon Cloud (and OpenStack in general), the difference between a Floating IP and a Private IP comes down to network scope and accessibility: 1. Private IP Scope: Internal to your OpenStack project’s network. Purpose: Lets instances communicate with each other inside your project (and sometimes within the site) without touching the public internet. Assigned: Automatically when you attach an instance to a private network. Accessible from: Other instances in the same network/project. Not directly reachable from the internet.
Example: 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x 2. Floating IP Scope: Publicly routable on the internet. Purpose: Maps a public IP to one of your instance’s private IPs so it can be accessed from outside Chameleon.
Assigned: You reserve a floating IP from the public pool and associate it with an instance. Accessible from: Anywhere on the internet (assuming security groups/firewall rules allow it). Example: 129.x.x.x (real, public IPv4) Key difference in behavior
Private IP: Like your computer’s LAN IP at home — local only.
Floating IP: Like your ISP-assigned public IP — visible to the outside world.  Tip: In Chameleon, you usually SSH into an instance using its Floating IP, but inside the cloud you connect instance-to-instance using Private IPs for lower latency and no public bandwidth usage.",0.2296918767507003,0.8105881214141846,0.22448979591836735,0.5788091127278816
10,Comparative,When should I use an FPGA node versus a GPU node?,"While the Chameleon documentation does not provide a direct comparison, the choice between an FPGA and a GPU depends on the specific requirements of your research, based on the fundamental differences in their architectures :   

Use a GPU Node for: High-throughput, data-parallel computations. GPUs contain thousands of cores optimized for performing the same operation on large amounts of data simultaneously. This makes them exceptionally well-suited for the matrix and vector operations that dominate deep learning model training and inference, scientific simulations, and high-performance computing (HPC).   

Use an FPGA Node for: Latency-critical or power-sensitive applications requiring custom hardware logic. An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is a fabric of reconfigurable logic blocks, not a fixed set of cores. This allows you to design and implement a custom digital circuit optimized for a specific algorithm. FPGAs can offer advantages in low-latency processing (e.g., network packet processing, real-time signal processing), power efficiency, and for prototyping novel hardware accelerators before committing to a final chip design (ASIC).",base_openai_model_answer,"Here’s the short version: use an FPGA node when you need custom, reconfigurable hardware logic, and use a GPU node when you need massively parallel numeric processing. FPGA nodes (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) Best for: Custom hardware acceleration for specialized algorithms (e.g., encryption/decryption, packet processing, signal processing). Low-latency workloads where deterministic timing is important. Prototyping and testing new hardware architectures.
Applications where power efficiency is critical for a specific computation pattern. Why: You can program the FPGA’s logic gates to execute tasks in hardware instead of software. Ideal for non-standard workloads that can’t be efficiently expressed in GPU shaders/kernels.
Examples: real-time analytics on streaming data, networking appliances, custom AI inference logic. GPU nodes (Graphics Processing Units) Best for: Parallelizable numerical workloads like deep learning, scientific simulations, image/video processing.
High-throughput linear algebra, matrix multiplications, and floating-point calculations. Frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, CUDA, or OpenCL.Why: Thousands of small cores optimized for SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) execution. Best when the computation is well-suited to batch processing large datasets in parallel.
Examples: training a neural network, rendering, large-scale fluid dynamics simulations. Rule of thumb FPGA: You need custom circuitry for specialized or unusual tasks — hardware-level customization is the priority. GPU: You need raw parallel compute power for data-heavy, math-heavy tasks — software-level programming is the priority.",0.15920398009950248,0.8219792246818542,0.2080536912751678,0.5003871166057402

15,Complex Query,How can I set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node?,"Chameleon's support for ""deep reconfigurability"" allows you to install and boot from a custom kernel on a bare metal node. The general process is as follows :   

Launch an Instance: Start by launching an instance from a ""whole disk image."" Most of the standard Chameleon-provided OS images (e.g., CC-Ubuntu20.04) are whole disk images suitable for this purpose.

Install Your Kernel: Once the instance is running, connect to it via SSH. Transfer your custom kernel and its associated modules to the instance and install them.

Modify the Bootloader: With root privileges, edit the bootloader configuration file (e.g., /boot/grub2/grub.cfg). Add a new menu entry that points to your new kernel and ramdisk files. You can also specify any custom kernel command-line parameters in this entry.

Reboot: Reboot the node. It will now boot using your specified custom kernel.

Note that for the cc-snapshot tool to work correctly with your custom environment, the size of your kernel's modules directory (/lib/modules/<kernel_version>) must be less than 4GB. ",base_openai_model_answer,"Here’s how you can set up an experiment on Chameleon that requires a specific Linux kernel version on a bare metal node: 1. Reserve a bare metal node Use the Horizon GUI or CLI to create a lease for the hardware you need. Make sure you select the right site (CHI@TACC, CHI@UC, etc.) and node type. 2. Choose a base image If Chameleon already provides an image with the kernel you want, you can use it directly. Otherwise, start from a standard Chameleon-provided image (e.g., CentOS, Ubuntu). 3. Install the specific kernel
Once the node is active, SSH in and install your desired kernel:
For Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt update sudo apt install linux-image-<version> For CentOS/RHEL: sudo yum install kernel-<version>
To see available versions: apt-cache search linux-image
# or yum list kernel 4. Set the default kernel After installation, update the bootloader to use your kernel by default: Ubuntu/Debian: sudo grub-set-default 0 sudo update-grub CentOS/RHEL: sudo grub2-set-default 0 sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg (0 here is the index of the kernel in the boot menu; you can adjust it.) 5. Reboot and verify sudo reboot uname -r Confirm that the output matches your target kernel version. 6. (Optional) Create a custom image
If you’ll repeat this experiment later: Use cc-snapshot (or Horizon’s Create Snapshot function) to save your configured node as a reusable image. That way, you won’t have to reinstall the kernel each time. Tip: Since Chameleon gives you bare metal access, you can even build and boot a custom-compiled kernel from source if the version you need isn’t in the package repositories.",0.22746781115879827,0.8132632970809937,0.10869565217391304,0.5065425595755518

17,How-To,How do I launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates?,"You can automate the deployment of complex, multi-node topologies using OpenStack's Heat orchestration service. The process uses a declarative YAML file called a Heat Orchestration Template (HOT).   

Here is the workflow to launch a multi-node ""stack"" :   

Create a Reservation: First, you must have an active lease with enough nodes to accommodate your entire deployment (e.g., if your template defines 1 server and 3 clients, you need a reservation for at least 4 nodes).

Navigate to Orchestration: In the Chameleon dashboard, go to Project > Orchestration > Stacks.

Launch Stack: Click the Launch Stack button.

Select Template: Specify your Heat template. You can upload the YAML file, paste its contents directly, or provide a URL to a template hosted online.

Enter Parameters: The interface will prompt you to enter values for any parameters defined in the template. This will always include a name for the stack, your password, the ID of your reservation, and an SSH key. It may also include custom parameters, like the number of client nodes to create.

Launch: Click Launch. Heat will then automatically provision all the resources—instances, networks, routers, etc.—as defined in your template.",base_openai_model_answer,"You can do it with a single Heat (OpenStack Orchestration) template using a ResourceGroup that repeats an OS::Nova::Server definition N times.

18,Factual Recall,Where are the main Chameleon hardware sites located?,"The main physical hardware sites for the Chameleon testbed are :   

CHI@TACC: Located at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) in Austin, Texas. This is the largest site and hosts the bulk of the large-scale compute resources.

CHI@UC: Hosted at the University of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois. This site has a focus on networking research and hosts a diverse range of GPUs and FPGAs.

CHI@NCAR: Situated at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. This site provides access to alternative processor architectures, such as ARM.

19,Troubleshooting,"Why can't my instance access the internet, even with a floating IP?","The most common reason an instance with a floating IP cannot be accessed from the internet is due to the host-based firewall running on the instance itself.   

Chameleon's supported operating system images (like Ubuntu and CentOS) are pre-configured with firewalld enabled by default for security. This firewall has restrictive rules that block most incoming connections from the public internet.   

To solve this, you must connect to your instance (e.g., via the web-based console) and explicitly open the ports for the services you need. For example, to allow incoming HTTP traffic, you would run a command like:
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
Followed by:
sudo firewall-cmd --reload",base_openai_model_answer,"If your Chameleon instance has a floating IP but still can’t access the internet, it’s usually because something is missing between the public network and your instance. Here’s the checklist to debug it: 1. Security groups Floating IPs can be assigned, but traffic will be blocked unless allowed by security group rules. Go to Project → Network → Security Groups, edit the group attached to your instance, and add: Egress rules for all IPs (0.0.0.0/0) Ingress rules for SSH (port 22) and any other needed ports If you need full outbound internet access, allow egress TCP/UDP on 80, 443, etc. 2. Router configuration In Chameleon, your private network must connect to the public network through a router:
Go to Project → Network → Routers. Ensure the router has an External Gateway set to the public network. Make sure your private subnet is added as an interface on that router. Without this, packets from your instance won’t reach the internet. 3. Instance network config
Inside your instance, check: ip addr ip route Make sure: The private IP is assigned to the correct interface. The default route points to the subnet’s gateway. 4. Floating IP association In Project → Compute → Instances, verify the floating IP is associated with the right port (the instance’s port on the private network). 5. DNS settings If pings to public IPs work but domain names fail, add DNS servers: sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf Add: nameserver 8.8.8.8 nameserver 1.1.1.1
6. Site-specific firewall rules Some Chameleon sites block certain outbound ports. If your app uses nonstandard ports, check the site documentation.

20,Complex Query,How can I repeat a networking experiment I found on the Chameleon blog to ensure reproducibility?,"Chameleon provides a complete ecosystem to ensure experiments can be easily reproduced. If an experiment from the blog was packaged for reproducibility, the process would be :   

Find the Artifact on Trovi: The experiment should be packaged as an ""artifact"" on the Trovi sharing portal. This artifact bundles all the necessary components: the Jupyter notebook that orchestrates the experiment, links to the custom disk images containing the required software, and any necessary configuration scripts or data.   

Launch the Jupyter Notebook: From the Trovi page, you can launch the artifact directly into Chameleon's Jupyter environment.

Execute the Notebook: The notebook will contain executable code cells that use Chameleon's Python library (python-chi) to programmatically handle the entire experimental lifecycle. This includes reserving the correct type of hardware, launching instances from the specific custom image, configuring the required networking (e.g., isolated VLANs), running the experiment, and collecting the results.   

Use Daypass for Access (if needed): If you don't have a Chameleon account, the experiment's author can grant you temporary, scoped access to the testbed using the Daypass feature, allowing you to run the artifact and reproduce the results",base_openai_model_answer,"To repeat a networking experiment from the Chameleon blog and make it fully reproducible, you’ll want to work from the same code, configuration, and hardware setup the authors used. Chameleon’s ecosystem (especially Trovi) makes that easier. 1. Check if there’s a Trovi artifact Many blog experiments link directly to a Trovi artifact.
Open the blog post and look for: A 'Launch in Chameleon' button. A Trovi URL (e.g., https://www.chameleoncloud.org/experiment/...). If available: Click the link → log in → launch the artifact. Trovi will automatically set up: The correct image Networking topology
Scripts and code Any special packages 2. Follow the exact hardware/network setup If no Trovi artifact: Identify resources used in the blog: Node type/flavor (e.g., compute_skylake, gpu_a100, fpga_xilinx) Network configuration (private network, router, floating IPs) Any leases/reservations used (bare metal, VLANs) Reserve nodes with the same specifications in Chameleon (via GUI or CLI). Recreate the network topology: Use Horizon’s Network → Networks/Routers.
Match subnets, IP ranges, and security group rules from the experiment. 3. Get the code and data Many blog experiments link to a GitHub repo. Clone it directly on your Chameleon instance: git clone <repo-url> cd <repo-folder> Check out the commit or tag mentioned in the blog for exact reproducibility: git checkout <commit-hash>
4. Match the software environment If the blog specifies a kernel, OS version, or specific packages, install them exactly. Use Conda, virtualenv, or Docker if they were used in the original setup. If they used a Chameleon-provided image, select that image when launching your instance. 5. Run the experiment Follow the blog’s instructions step-by-step. Keep notes on: Parameter values Command output Any deviations from the original steps 6. Save your work for your reproducibility Once it works, create: A snapshot image if you want to preserve your configured node.

1,Factual Recall,What is the purpose of the Chameleon Associate Sites?,"Chameleon Associate Sites are independently-owned and operated hardware resources at other institutions that are integrated into the main Chameleon testbed. Their purpose is twofold:   

For the Chameleon Community: They expand the testbed's scale and hardware diversity, offering unique capabilities not available at the core sites. For example, the site at Northwestern University (CHI@NU) provides nodes with 100G NICs for advanced networking experiments. These resources are available to all Chameleon users through the federated login system.   

For the Host Institution: They provide a turnkey solution for institutions to establish their own research cloud without the high cost and operational overhead of developing the infrastructure from scratch. The central Chameleon team handles user support, system upgrades, and provides a suite of operational tools, allowing the host institution to focus on managing its physical hardware.   

This federation is made possible by CHI-in-a-Box, a distributable software package containing the entire Chameleon infrastructure stack.",model_7_answer,"The purpose of Chameleon Associate Sites is to provide a way for providers to add resources to the Chameleon testbed while retaining their own project identity and branding.

3,How-To,How do I create an isolated network for my instances using the GUI?,"You can create an isolated network, which functions as a private Layer-2 VLAN, through the Chameleon web dashboard. This allows you to run your own network services, like DHCP, without interfering with other users. Here is the step-by-step process :   

Create the Network and Subnet:

Navigate to the Network > Networks page and click the +Create Network button.

In the wizard, give your network a name.

On the Subnet tab, provide a name for the subnet and define its private IP address range in CIDR notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).

On the Subnet Details tab, you can optionally configure DHCP allocation pools and specify DNS servers. Click Create to finish.

Create a Router:

Navigate to the Network > Routers page and click +Create Router.

Give the router a name and click Create Router.

Connect the Router to the Subnet:

5,Troubleshooting,"My bare metal node is stuck in the ""deploying"" state for a long time. What should I do?","If a bare metal node remains in the ""deploying"" state for an extended period, it may be experiencing an issue during the boot or provisioning process. The recommended course of action is :   

Wait: The deployment process for a physical node can sometimes take several minutes. It is advisable to wait at least 10-15 minutes to see if the process completes on its own.

Contact Support: If the node is still stuck after this waiting period, you should open a ticket with the Chameleon Help Desk. The operations team can investigate the underlying cause of the deployment failure and resolve the issue. ",model_7_answer,"Given that your bare metal node is stuck in the ""deploying"" state for a long time, I'll provide you with possible solutions based on the provided context.

Firstly, it's essential to check if the issue is due to connectivity problems. According to the context, being stuck at 2/4 (device doesn't have connectivity to the internet) is a common issue. However, in your case, the internet connection was healthy, and it was a misconfiguration on our side giving an old config to PI5s, so the k3s worker never started.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following:

1. **Wait for 10 minutes**: Sometimes, the node takes longer than expected to boot up. Wait for 10 minutes before retrying.
2. **Check your SSH connection**: Ensure that you're using the correct account (cc) and that your SSH connection is stable. If you still cannot connect after 10 minutes, open a ticket with our Help Desk.
3. **Run cc-checks**: Run `sudo cc-checks -v` to check if the resource matches its known description in the resource registry. This might help identify any issues with the node's configuration.

If none of these solutions work, it's possible that there are internal hardware/networking issues. In this case, it's best to report the issue to the help desk for further assistance.

6,Troubleshooting,"I get an ""Error 403: Forbidden"" when trying to use the OpenStack CLI. What's wrong?","An ""Error 403: Forbidden"" when using the OpenStack command-line interface (CLI) is most commonly caused by missing or improperly sourced credentials.   

To use the CLI, you must first authenticate your session. This is done by sourcing an OpenStack RC script (often called a novarc file) in your terminal. This file contains the necessary environment variables (like your username, password, project ID, and authentication URL) that the CLI tools need to communicate with the Chameleon API.

Solution: Ensure you have downloaded your project's OpenStack RC script from the Chameleon dashboard and have sourced it correctly in your terminal session (e.g., by running source your-project-openrc.sh) before executing any other commands.",model_7_answer,"The issue you're experiencing with the ""Error 403: Forbidden"" when using the OpenStack CLI is likely due to an authentication problem. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including incorrect environment variables or an outdated version of the OpenStack client.

To resolve this issue, I recommend checking your terminal session for correct configuration and ensuring that you have the latest version of the OpenStack client installed. You can do this by running `openstack --version` to check the current version.

Additionally, make sure that you have correctly set up your environment variables using the OpenStack RC Script. If you're on a macOS or Linux system, try re-running the `source <path/to/openstack_rc_file>` command and then typing `openstack` in your terminal session.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, it's possible that there is an intermittent problem with the KVM upgrades, as mentioned in another thread. In this case, you may want to try re-downloading the openrc file and see if that resolves the issue.

8,Conceptual,"What does it mean for Chameleon to support ""deep reconfigurability""?","""Deep reconfigurability"" is the core design principle of the Chameleon testbed. It means giving researchers an unparalleled level of control over the entire software stack on physical, non-virtualized hardware. This is achieved through several key features:   

Bare Metal Access: Researchers are given exclusive access to entire physical servers, ensuring that experiments are free from the performance interference (""noise"") that can occur in shared or virtualized environments.   

Full Administrative Privileges: Users have root (sudo) access on their reserved nodes. This allows them to install a custom operating system, modify the kernel, change bootloader configurations, and access the machine's serial console.   

This level of control is essential for many areas of computer science systems research where the experiment involves modifying the operating system itself or requires precise, repeatable performance measurements.",model_7_answer,"Deep reconfigurability in Chameleon refers to its ability to dynamically change and adapt its hardware and software configurations to meet the needs of various research experiments. This is achieved through features such as composable hardware, which allows for flexible GPU configurations, supporting up to 8 GPUs per node, and KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) volumes that enable persistent storage devices to be added to instances.

Additionally, Chameleon's support for FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays), Trovi Sharing Portal, Daypass, and other services further enhance its reconfigurability. The platform also allows users to snapshot their experimental environments, making it easy to redeploy them later, which is a key aspect of reproducibility.

The dynamic nature of Chameleon's infrastructure enables researchers to quickly adapt to changing experiment requirements, reducing the time and effort needed to set up and run experiments. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for edge computing research, as demonstrated by CHI@Edge, which provides a cutting-edge testbed tailored to the dynamic needs of edge computing and IoT research.

9,Comparative,What is the difference between a Floating IP and a Private IP?,"On Chameleon, Private IPs and Floating IPs serve distinct networking purposes :   

Private IP (Fixed IP): This is an IP address assigned to an instance for communication within Chameleon's internal network (e.g., sharednet1). It is not directly reachable from the public internet. Instances use their private IP to communicate with each other and to initiate outbound connections to the internet through a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway.   

Floating IP: This is a publicly routable IPv4 address that can be dynamically associated with an instance. A Floating IP is required for an instance to be directly accessible from the public internet (for example, to connect via SSH from your laptop or to host a public web server). Floating IPs are a limited, shared resource, so users are encouraged to release them when they are no longer needed. ",model_7_answer,"A Floating IP is a publicly accessible IP address that can be associated with an instance in Chameleon Cloud, making it reachable directly over the public Internet. This allows users to access their instances from anywhere without having to worry about network configurations.

On the other hand, a Private IP is an internal IP address assigned to an instance within the cloud environment. It's not routable from the public Internet and is used for communication between instances within the same project or network.

The key differences between Floating IPs and Private IPs are:

* Accessibility: A Floating IP is publicly accessible, while a Private IP is only accessible within the cloud environment.
* Routing: A Floating IP can be routed over the public Internet, while a Private IP is not routable from the public Internet.
* Security: Since a Floating IP is publicly accessible, it's essential to consider security measures to protect services running on instances with associated Floating IPs.

10,Comparative,When should I use an FPGA node versus a GPU node?,"While the Chameleon documentation does not provide a direct comparison, the choice between an FPGA and a GPU depends on the specific requirements of your research, based on the fundamental differences in their architectures :   

Use a GPU Node for: High-throughput, data-parallel computations. GPUs contain thousands of cores optimized for performing the same operation on large amounts of data simultaneously. This makes them exceptionally well-suited for the matrix and vector operations that dominate deep learning model training and inference, scientific simulations, and high-performance computing (HPC).   

Use an FPGA Node for: Latency-critical or power-sensitive applications requiring custom hardware logic. An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is a fabric of reconfigurable logic blocks, not a fixed set of cores. This allows you to design and implement a custom digital circuit optimized for a specific algorithm. FPGAs can offer advantages in low-latency processing (e.g., network packet processing, real-time signal processing), power efficiency, and for prototyping novel hardware accelerators before committing to a final chip design (ASIC).",model_7_answer,"When deciding between using an FPGA node versus a GPU node on Chameleon Cloud, consider the following factors:

1. **Compute-intensive tasks**: FPGAs are ideal for tasks that require high-performance computing and can be accelerated with custom hardware logic. If your application involves complex computations, data processing, or machine learning workloads, an FPGA node might be more suitable.
2. **Customization and flexibility**: FPGAs offer the ability to customize the hardware architecture to fit specific needs, making them a good choice for applications that require unique configurations or interfaces.
3. **Power efficiency**: FPGAs are generally more power-efficient than GPUs, which can lead to cost savings and reduced environmental impact.

On the other hand:

1. **General-purpose computing**: GPU nodes are better suited for general-purpose computing tasks, such as data analytics, scientific simulations, and machine learning workloads that don't require custom hardware logic.
2. **Availability and ease of use**: GPU nodes are more widely available and easier to use, with a larger community of developers and more extensive documentation.

Considering the provided context, if you need to perform compute-intensive tasks or require customization and flexibility in your application, an FPGA node might be the better choice. However, if you're working on general-purpose computing tasks or prefer a more straightforward setup, a GPU node could be more suitable.

12,How-To,How do I attach a volume to my running instance?,"You can attach a persistent block storage volume to a running virtual machine on the KVM@TACC site. This feature is not available for bare metal nodes. The process is done through the GUI :   

Navigate to the Volumes > Volumes page in the KVM@TACC dashboard.

Locate the volume you wish to attach in the list. In its ""Actions"" dropdown menu, select Manage Attachments.

In the dialog box that appears, select your running instance from the dropdown menu.

Click the Attach Volume button.

After the volume is attached, you must log in to the instance via SSH to partition, format, and mount the new block device before you can use it.",model_7_answer,"To attach a volume to your running instance, follow these steps:

First, ensure you have created a new volume with the desired size and type (ceph-hdd or ceph-ssd). You can do this by going to the ""Volumes"" tab in the Chameleon dashboard, clicking on ""Create Volume"", entering a name and size, and selecting the storage type.

Once your volume is created, you'll need to attach it to your instance. To do this, go to the ""Manage Attachments"" action for your volume, select your instance from the dropdown menu, and confirm by clicking ""Attach Volume"". You can find this option on the ""Volume overview"" page.

After attaching the volume, you'll see which device the volume will appear inside your instance.

However, there is some flexibility. You can extend an active lease for another seven days as long as you do so within 48 hours of its expiration and no other user has already reserved the hardware for that time.

14,Negative Question,Can I use my Chameleon allocation to mine cryptocurrency?,"No, you cannot. Chameleon's Acceptable Use Policy explicitly prohibits running applications that mine cryptocurrency or use blockchain technology for personal financial gain.   

As a publicly funded research instrument supported by the National Science Foundation, Chameleon resources must be used exclusively for research and educational work. Cryptocurrency mining is considered a commercial or personal-gain activity that consumes significant resources and is therefore outside the testbed's mission. An exception may be granted for legitimate    

research into blockchain technology, but this requires advance, explicit approval from the Chameleon team.",model_7_answer,"You cannot use your Chameleon allocation to mine cryptocurrency. According to the provided context, Chameleon's primary purpose is for computer science research and experimentation, and its terms of service emphasize ""open"" research that results in publication in a broadly available journal or conference.

The context also mentions that specialized hardware on Chameleon can sometimes be in high demand and low supply, and that resource reservations (leases) are subject to policies aimed at ensuring fairness to all users. Mining cryptocurrency would likely require significant computational resources for an extended period, which could conflict with these policies and potentially disrupt the research activities of other users.

Additionally, the context does not provide any information on how to use Chameleon for cryptocurrency mining or any related activities.

15,Complex Query,How can I set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node?,"Chameleon's support for ""deep reconfigurability"" allows you to install and boot from a custom kernel on a bare metal node. The general process is as follows :   

Launch an Instance: Start by launching an instance from a ""whole disk image."" Most of the standard Chameleon-provided OS images (e.g., CC-Ubuntu20.04) are whole disk images suitable for this purpose.

Install Your Kernel: Once the instance is running, connect to it via SSH. Transfer your custom kernel and its associated modules to the instance and install them.

Modify the Bootloader: With root privileges, edit the bootloader configuration file (e.g., /boot/grub2/grub.cfg). Add a new menu entry that points to your new kernel and ramdisk files. You can also specify any custom kernel command-line parameters in this entry.

Reboot: Reboot the node. It will now boot using your specified custom kernel.

Note that for the cc-snapshot tool to work correctly with your custom environment, the size of your kernel's modules directory (/lib/modules/<kernel_version>) must be less than 4GB. ",model_7_answer,"To set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node, you can follow these steps:

First, ensure that your experiment is compatible with the Chameleon testbed by checking the documentation for any specific requirements or restrictions. If your experiment is already on GitHub and requires a single bare metal node, you can jump to step 3.

1. **Update the hardware query**: If there are specific requirements for the type of node your experiment runs on, update the `hardware query` in step 1 to ensure that the correct node is reserved.
2. **Use the `resource_properties` parameter**: When reserving a bare metal node, use the `resource_properties` parameter to specify the kernel version required by your experiment. For example:
```bash
resource_properties='[""="",
""$kernel_id"",
""78dbf26565cf24050718674dcf322331fab8ead5""]'
```
This will reserve a node with the specified kernel version.

3. **Update the setup scripts**: If necessary, update the setup scripts to install and configure the required kernel version on the reserved node.
4. **Run the experiment**: Once the node is set up, run your experiment as usual.

Note that you may need to adapt the experiment execution and analysis steps (steps 4 and 5) according to your specific requirements.

16,Conceptual,What is the Trovi artifacts repository?,"Trovi is Chameleon's sharing portal and repository for digital research artifacts. Its primary purpose is to facilitate    

reproducible science by allowing users to package, share, and discover complete experiments.   

An artifact in Trovi is more than just code; it's a ""compute capsule"" that can contain a collection of components, including :   

Jupyter notebooks that orchestrate the experiment.

Links to the specific custom disk images needed.

Heat orchestration templates for multi-node deployments.

Datasets and documentation.

This packaging allows another researcher to find an experiment on Trovi and, with a single click, launch it directly on Chameleon to verify, replicate, or build upon the work.",model_7_answer,"The Trovi artifacts repository is a service designed for packaging and sharing reproducible artifacts in testbeds. It allows users to import their GitHub repositories as artifacts, which can then be launched into a JupyterLab environment with automatic authentication and pre-equipped libraries.

When creating an artifact, users can choose to import from a Git repository, specifying the remote URL and commit version. The metadata file used by Trovi follows the RO-crate specification, ensuring detailed descriptions of the package and facilitating interoperability across different platforms.

Trovi integrates seamlessly with Chameleon, enabling users to launch artifacts into a JupyterLab environment that comes pre-equipped with commonly used libraries. The service also supports seamless GitHub integration, allowing authors to create and edit artifacts directly in the dashboard and configure their GitHub repository with metadata files for their artifact.

The Trovi artifacts repository is designed to be portable and interoperable, aligning with FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). By keeping the metadata file closer to the artifact contents, authors can more easily adhere to these principles in their work, regardless of which testbed platform they ultimately use.

17,How-To,How do I launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates?,"You can automate the deployment of complex, multi-node topologies using OpenStack's Heat orchestration service. The process uses a declarative YAML file called a Heat Orchestration Template (HOT).   

Here is the workflow to launch a multi-node ""stack"" :   

Create a Reservation: First, you must have an active lease with enough nodes to accommodate your entire deployment (e.g., if your template defines 1 server and 3 clients, you need a reservation for at least 4 nodes).

Navigate to Orchestration: In the Chameleon dashboard, go to Project > Orchestration > Stacks.

Launch Stack: Click the Launch Stack button.

Select Template: Specify your Heat template. You can upload the YAML file, paste its contents directly, or provide a URL to a template hosted online.

Enter Parameters: The interface will prompt you to enter values for any parameters defined in the template. This will always include a name for the stack, your password, the ID of your reservation, and an SSH key. It may also include custom parameters, like the number of client nodes to create.

Launch: Click Launch. Heat will then automatically provision all the resources—instances, networks, routers, etc.—as defined in your template.",model_7_answer,"To launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates, you can utilize resource groups. A resource group is a construct from Heat that allows you to define one kind of resource and request it to be created any number of times.

Here's an example of how you can modify the provided template to use a resource group:

```yaml
resources:
  nfs_clients:
    type: OS::Heat::ResourceGroup
    properties:
      count: 2
      resource_def:
        type: OS::Nova::Server
        properties:
          flavor: baremetal
          image: CC-CentOS7
          key_name: { get_param: key_name }
          networks:
            - network: sharednet1
          scheduler_hints: { reservation: { get_param: reservation_id } }
          user_data:
            str_replace:
              template: |
                #!/bin/bash
                yum install -y nfs-utils
                echo ""$nfs_server_ip:/exports/example    /mnt/    nfs"" > /etc/fstab
                mount -a
              params:
                $nfs_server_ip: { get_attr: [nfs_server, first_address] }
```

In this example, the `nfs_clients` resource group is defined with a count of 2. This will launch two instances of the specified server.

You can then use the following command to launch the stack:

```bash
openstack stack create -t <template_name> --parameter key_name=<key_name> --parameter reservation_id=<reservation_id>
```

Replace `<template_name>` with the name of your template, and `<key_name>` and `<reservation_id>` with the actual values for your key pair and reservation.

19,Troubleshooting,"Why can't my instance access the internet, even with a floating IP?","The most common reason an instance with a floating IP cannot be accessed from the internet is due to the host-based firewall running on the instance itself.   

Chameleon's supported operating system images (like Ubuntu and CentOS) are pre-configured with firewalld enabled by default for security. This firewall has restrictive rules that block most incoming connections from the public internet.   

To solve this, you must connect to your instance (e.g., via the web-based console) and explicitly open the ports for the services you need. For example, to allow incoming HTTP traffic, you would run a command like:
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
Followed by:
sudo firewall-cmd --reload",model_7_answer,"Your instance is unable to access the internet because you haven't associated a Floating IP Address with it. By default, instances do not have publicly-accessible IP addresses assigned.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that there is a free Floating IP available in your project. If not, click the Allocate IP to Project button to allocate a new one.
2. Once you have allocated a Floating IP, go back to your instance and click on the Associate button for the Floating IP.

20,Complex Query,How can I repeat a networking experiment I found on the Chameleon blog to ensure reproducibility?,"Chameleon provides a complete ecosystem to ensure experiments can be easily reproduced. If an experiment from the blog was packaged for reproducibility, the process would be :   

Find the Artifact on Trovi: The experiment should be packaged as an ""artifact"" on the Trovi sharing portal. This artifact bundles all the necessary components: the Jupyter notebook that orchestrates the experiment, links to the custom disk images containing the required software, and any necessary configuration scripts or data.   

Launch the Jupyter Notebook: From the Trovi page, you can launch the artifact directly into Chameleon's Jupyter environment.

Execute the Notebook: The notebook will contain executable code cells that use Chameleon's Python library (python-chi) to programmatically handle the entire experimental lifecycle. This includes reserving the correct type of hardware, launching instances from the specific custom image, configuring the required networking (e.g., isolated VLANs), running the experiment, and collecting the results.   

Use Daypass for Access (if needed): If you don't have a Chameleon account, the experiment's author can grant you temporary, scoped access to the testbed using the Daypass feature, allowing you to run the artifact and reproduce the results",model_7_answer,"To repeat a networking experiment on Chameleon, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the experiment**: Find the specific tutorial or blog post that describes the experiment you want to replicate.
2. **Understand the requirements**: Read through the experiment's documentation to understand its requirements, including any specific hardware or software needs.
3. **Create a new lease and instance**: Use Chameleon's Jupyter Notebook interface to create a new lease and instance for your experiment. This will give you access to the necessary resources.
4. **Provision a single node**: Allocate a single node for your experiment, making sure it meets the requirements specified in the tutorial or blog post.
5. **Copy experiment files and install dependencies**: Transfer the experiment's files to your allocated node and install any required dependencies.
6. **Run the experiment and upload data**: Execute the experiment on your node and upload any generated data.
7. **Analyze data**: Use Chameleon's Jupyter Notebook interface or other tools to analyze the collected data.

To ensure reproducibility, consider the following:

* Make sure to reserve resources in advance using Chameleon's reservation system.
* Assign a value for ""Hours a user has to reproduce"" when creating an artifact, specifying how long a user will have access to Chameleon for.
* Use Trovi sharing portal to package and share complete experimental environments.

By following these steps and considering reproducibility, you should be able to successfully repeat the networking experiment on Chameleon.

1,Factual Recall,What is the purpose of the Chameleon Associate Sites?,"Chameleon Associate Sites are independently-owned and operated hardware resources at other institutions that are integrated into the main Chameleon testbed. Their purpose is twofold:   

For the Chameleon Community: They expand the testbed's scale and hardware diversity, offering unique capabilities not available at the core sites. For example, the site at Northwestern University (CHI@NU) provides nodes with 100G NICs for advanced networking experiments. These resources are available to all Chameleon users through the federated login system.   

For the Host Institution: They provide a turnkey solution for institutions to establish their own research cloud without the high cost and operational overhead of developing the infrastructure from scratch. The central Chameleon team handles user support, system upgrades, and provides a suite of operational tools, allowing the host institution to focus on managing its physical hardware.   

This federation is made possible by CHI-in-a-Box, a distributable software package containing the entire Chameleon infrastructure stack.",model_8_answer,"The purpose of the Chameleon Associate Sites is to allow providers to add resources to the Chameleon testbed while retaining their own project identity and branding. These resources are discoverable and available to all Chameleon users, but with the provider's own policies and user support handled by the Chameleon team.

5,Troubleshooting,"My bare metal node is stuck in the ""deploying"" state for a long time. What should I do?","If a bare metal node remains in the ""deploying"" state for an extended period, it may be experiencing an issue during the boot or provisioning process. The recommended course of action is :   

Wait: The deployment process for a physical node can sometimes take several minutes. It is advisable to wait at least 10-15 minutes to see if the process completes on its own.

Contact Support: If the node is still stuck after this waiting period, you should open a ticket with the Chameleon Help Desk. The operations team can investigate the underlying cause of the deployment failure and resolve the issue. ",model_8_answer,"Based on your question, it seems like you're experiencing an issue with a bare metal node being stuck in the ""deploying"" state for a long time. I'll synthesize information from all relevant context sources to provide a helpful answer.

The provided context suggests that there could be several reasons why your bare metal node is stuck in the ""deploying"" state. According to the Chameleon documentation, it's possible that the issue might be related to connectivity problems or misconfigurations on their side.

One potential solution mentioned in the context is to check if the internet connection is healthy and if there are any issues with the target configuration being pulled down by the device. However, since you've confirmed that the internet connection was healthy, we can rule out this possibility.

Another possible cause of the issue could be a misconfiguration on their side, as mentioned in the context. In this case, it's likely that the k3s worker never started due to an old config being given to PI5s.

To troubleshoot the issue further, you may want to check if there are any SSH errors such as connection refused, password requests, or failures to accept your key. If you notice these issues, it might be because the physical node is still going through the boot process, and you should wait before retrying.

If none of these solutions work, you can try removing any previous entries for the instance's Floating IP from your ~/.ssh/known_hosts file using the ssh-keygen -R <floating_ip> command. This might resolve the issue if there are any authentication problems.

In summary, to resolve the issue with your bare metal node being stuck in the ""deploying"" state, you can try checking for connectivity issues, misconfigurations on their side, SSH errors, and removing previous entries from your known_hosts file.

6,Troubleshooting,"I get an ""Error 403: Forbidden"" when trying to use the OpenStack CLI. What's wrong?","An ""Error 403: Forbidden"" when using the OpenStack command-line interface (CLI) is most commonly caused by missing or improperly sourced credentials.   

To use the CLI, you must first authenticate your session. This is done by sourcing an OpenStack RC script (often called a novarc file) in your terminal. This file contains the necessary environment variables (like your username, password, project ID, and authentication URL) that the CLI tools need to communicate with the Chameleon API.

Solution: Ensure you have downloaded your project's OpenStack RC script from the Chameleon dashboard and have sourced it correctly in your terminal session (e.g., by running source your-project-openrc.sh) before executing any other commands.",model_8_answer,"The issue you're experiencing with ""Error 403: Forbidden"" when using the OpenStack CLI is likely due to an intermittent problem that occurred after recent KVM upgrades. This has been fixed, and redownloading the openrc file should resolve the issue.

However, if you're still encountering problems, it's possible that your terminal session hasn't been configured correctly with environment variables. Ensure that you've properly sourced the OpenStack RC script (which is v3) and are using the latest version of the OpenStack client. You can check the client version by running `openstack --version`.

If you're experiencing a ""The request you have made requires authentication"" error, it's likely because your terminal session hasn't been configured correctly with environment variables.

8,Conceptual,"What does it mean for Chameleon to support ""deep reconfigurability""?","""Deep reconfigurability"" is the core design principle of the Chameleon testbed. It means giving researchers an unparalleled level of control over the entire software stack on physical, non-virtualized hardware. This is achieved through several key features:   

Bare Metal Access: Researchers are given exclusive access to entire physical servers, ensuring that experiments are free from the performance interference (""noise"") that can occur in shared or virtualized environments.   

Full Administrative Privileges: Users have root (sudo) access on their reserved nodes. This allows them to install a custom operating system, modify the kernel, change bootloader configurations, and access the machine's serial console.   

This level of control is essential for many areas of computer science systems research where the experiment involves modifying the operating system itself or requires precise, repeatable performance measurements.",model_8_answer,"Deep reconfigurability in Chameleon refers to the ability to dynamically and deeply change the configuration of hardware resources, such as GPUs, FPGAs, or other devices, within the testbed. This allows researchers to adapt their experiments and simulations to different scenarios, optimize resource utilization, and explore new research questions without being limited by fixed hardware configurations.

Chameleon's support for deep reconfigurability is demonstrated through its introduction of GigaIO's composable hardware, which enables flexible GPU configurations with up to 8 GPUs per node. Additionally, the testbed has been actively enhancing its FPGA capabilities, including the development of new offerings and improved workflows for utilizing FPGAs.

The concept of deep reconfigurability also aligns with Chameleon's focus on supporting edge computing research through CHI@Edge, which provides a range of devices tailored for high-performance yet low-power edge computing tasks. The testbed's ability to dynamically change hardware configurations enables researchers to explore the dynamic needs of edge computing and IoT research.

9,Comparative,What is the difference between a Floating IP and a Private IP?,"On Chameleon, Private IPs and Floating IPs serve distinct networking purposes :   

Private IP (Fixed IP): This is an IP address assigned to an instance for communication within Chameleon's internal network (e.g., sharednet1). It is not directly reachable from the public internet. Instances use their private IP to communicate with each other and to initiate outbound connections to the internet through a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway.   

Floating IP: This is a publicly routable IPv4 address that can be dynamically associated with an instance. A Floating IP is required for an instance to be directly accessible from the public internet (for example, to connect via SSH from your laptop or to host a public web server). Floating IPs are a limited, shared resource, so users are encouraged to release them when they are no longer needed. ",model_8_answer,"A Floating IP and a Private IP are two different types of IP addresses used in the context of cloud computing, specifically within Chameleon Cloud.

**Private IP**: A Private IP is an internal IP address assigned to an instance by the cloud provider. It's not routable over the public internet and is only accessible from within the cloud network. Private IPs are used for communication between instances within a project or subnet. They are not exposed to the public internet, which makes them more secure.

**Floating IP**: A Floating IP, on the other hand, is a publicly routable IP address that can be associated with an instance. It's called ""floating"" because it can be moved from one instance to another without changing its external IP address. When you associate a Floating IP with an instance, it becomes accessible over the public internet.

In summary, while both types of IPs are used for communication, Private IPs are internal and not exposed to the public, whereas Floating IPs are publicly routable and can be accessed from anywhere on the internet.

10,Comparative,When should I use an FPGA node versus a GPU node?,"While the Chameleon documentation does not provide a direct comparison, the choice between an FPGA and a GPU depends on the specific requirements of your research, based on the fundamental differences in their architectures :   

Use a GPU Node for: High-throughput, data-parallel computations. GPUs contain thousands of cores optimized for performing the same operation on large amounts of data simultaneously. This makes them exceptionally well-suited for the matrix and vector operations that dominate deep learning model training and inference, scientific simulations, and high-performance computing (HPC).   

Use an FPGA Node for: Latency-critical or power-sensitive applications requiring custom hardware logic. An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is a fabric of reconfigurable logic blocks, not a fixed set of cores. This allows you to design and implement a custom digital circuit optimized for a specific algorithm. FPGAs can offer advantages in low-latency processing (e.g., network packet processing, real-time signal processing), power efficiency, and for prototyping novel hardware accelerators before committing to a final chip design (ASIC).",model_8_answer,"When deciding between using an FPGA node and a GPU node on Chameleon Cloud, consider the following factors:

FPGA nodes are suitable for applications that require custom hardware acceleration, such as high-performance computing (HPC) workloads, data processing, and machine learning tasks that can be optimized with reconfigurable logic. They offer flexibility in terms of customization and can provide significant performance improvements over traditional CPU-based architectures.

On the other hand, GPU nodes are ideal for applications that require massive parallel processing, such as deep learning, scientific simulations, and data analytics. The H100 GPUs available on Chameleon Cloud provide high-bandwidth memory and a large number of CUDA cores, making them well-suited for tasks that can be efficiently parallelized.

If you need to run experiments with specific hardware configurations or require the flexibility to scale up or down depending on your needs, FPGA nodes might be a better choice. However, if you're working with applications that can take advantage of massive parallel processing and don't require custom hardware acceleration, GPU nodes are likely a more suitable option.

14,Negative Question,Can I use my Chameleon allocation to mine cryptocurrency?,"No, you cannot. Chameleon's Acceptable Use Policy explicitly prohibits running applications that mine cryptocurrency or use blockchain technology for personal financial gain.   

As a publicly funded research instrument supported by the National Science Foundation, Chameleon resources must be used exclusively for research and educational work. Cryptocurrency mining is considered a commercial or personal-gain activity that consumes significant resources and is therefore outside the testbed's mission. An exception may be granted for legitimate    

research into blockchain technology, but this requires advance, explicit approval from the Chameleon team.",model_8_answer,"You cannot use your Chameleon allocation to mine cryptocurrency. According to the provided context, Chameleon is a testbed for computer science research that provides bare metal access to nodes for experimentation and testing purposes. The terms of service explicitly state that users should not attempt to stack reservations to circumvent the 7-day lease limitation, which suggests that mining cryptocurrency would be considered an abuse of the system.

Additionally, the context mentions that Chameleon operates on a ""soft allocation model"" where each project receives a startup allocation of 20,000 SUs for six months. This allocation is designed to cover significant experimentation while ensuring fair access for all users. Mining cryptocurrency would likely require a large amount of computational resources and could potentially disrupt the balance of the system.

15,Complex Query,How can I set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node?,"Chameleon's support for ""deep reconfigurability"" allows you to install and boot from a custom kernel on a bare metal node. The general process is as follows :   

Launch an Instance: Start by launching an instance from a ""whole disk image."" Most of the standard Chameleon-provided OS images (e.g., CC-Ubuntu20.04) are whole disk images suitable for this purpose.

Install Your Kernel: Once the instance is running, connect to it via SSH. Transfer your custom kernel and its associated modules to the instance and install them.

Modify the Bootloader: With root privileges, edit the bootloader configuration file (e.g., /boot/grub2/grub.cfg). Add a new menu entry that points to your new kernel and ramdisk files. You can also specify any custom kernel command-line parameters in this entry.

Reboot: Reboot the node. It will now boot using your specified custom kernel.

Note that for the cc-snapshot tool to work correctly with your custom environment, the size of your kernel's modules directory (/lib/modules/<kernel_version>) must be less than 4GB. ",model_8_answer,"To set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node, follow these steps:

First, ensure your experiment is compatible with bare metal nodes. If it's already on GitHub and requires a single bare metal node, you can jump to step 3 to point to your repository and update the setup scripts as needed.

1. **Update hardware query**: If there are specific requirements for the type of node your experiment runs on, update the `hardware query` in step 1 of the Chameleon documentation.
2. **Install dependencies**: Install Docker and docker-compose if necessary. You can do this by running the provided commands to add Docker's official GPG key, add the repository to Apt sources, and install Docker CE, Docker CE CLI, containerd.io, Docker Buildx Plugin, and Docker Compose Plugin.
3. **Update experiment execution and analysis**: Adapt steps 4 and 5 of the Chameleon documentation to suit your specific needs.

To ensure you have the correct kernel version on a bare metal node:

* You can specify the kernel version when creating the instance in step 2 of the UC Terraform example (resource ""openstack_compute_instance_v2"" ""test_instance_uc""). However, this might not be directly applicable to your experiment setup.
* Alternatively, you may need to manually update the kernel on the bare metal node after it's created. This can typically be done by running `sudo apt-get update` followed by `sudo apt-get install linux-image-<version>` (replace `<version>` with the desired kernel version).

Please note that the specific steps for updating the kernel might vary depending on your experiment and the Chameleon environment.

17,How-To,How do I launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates?,"You can automate the deployment of complex, multi-node topologies using OpenStack's Heat orchestration service. The process uses a declarative YAML file called a Heat Orchestration Template (HOT).   

Here is the workflow to launch a multi-node ""stack"" :   

Create a Reservation: First, you must have an active lease with enough nodes to accommodate your entire deployment (e.g., if your template defines 1 server and 3 clients, you need a reservation for at least 4 nodes).

Navigate to Orchestration: In the Chameleon dashboard, go to Project > Orchestration > Stacks.

Launch Stack: Click the Launch Stack button.

Select Template: Specify your Heat template. You can upload the YAML file, paste its contents directly, or provide a URL to a template hosted online.

Enter Parameters: The interface will prompt you to enter values for any parameters defined in the template. This will always include a name for the stack, your password, the ID of your reservation, and an SSH key. It may also include custom parameters, like the number of client nodes to create.

Launch: Click Launch. Heat will then automatically provision all the resources—instances, networks, routers, etc.—as defined in your template.",model_8_answer,"To launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates, you can use resource groups. A resource group is defined in the template as follows:

```yaml
nfs_clients:
  type: OS::Heat::ResourceGroup
  properties:
    count: 2
    resource_def:
      type: OS::Nova::Server
      properties:
        flavor: baremetal
        image: CC-CentOS7
        key_name: { get_param: key_name }
        networks:
          - network: sharednet1
            scheduler_hints: { reservation: { get_param: reservation_id } }
        user_data:
          str_replace:
            template: |
              #!/bin/bash
              yum install -y nfs-utils
              echo ""$nfs_server_ip:/exports/example    /mnt/    nfs"" > /etc/fstab
              mount -a
            params:
              $nfs_server_ip: { get_attr: [nfs_server, first_address] }
```

In this example, the `count` property is set to 2, which means that two instances of the specified resource will be created. The `resource_def` property defines the type and properties of the resource to be created.

To launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates, you can use the following steps:

1. Create a new stack in the Chameleon dashboard.
2. Select ""URL"" as the template source and paste the URL of your Heat template into the template URL field.
3. Click the ""Next"" button to navigate to the launch stack dialog.
4. Enter the required parameters, such as the name of the stack and the reservation ID.
5. Click the ""Launch"" button to launch the stack.

Note that you can also use the CLI to launch a stack with multiple nodes. You can use the `heat stack-create` command to create a new stack, and then use the `--parameters` option to specify the required parameters.

19,Troubleshooting,"Why can't my instance access the internet, even with a floating IP?","The most common reason an instance with a floating IP cannot be accessed from the internet is due to the host-based firewall running on the instance itself.   

Chameleon's supported operating system images (like Ubuntu and CentOS) are pre-configured with firewalld enabled by default for security. This firewall has restrictive rules that block most incoming connections from the public internet.   

To solve this, you must connect to your instance (e.g., via the web-based console) and explicitly open the ports for the services you need. For example, to allow incoming HTTP traffic, you would run a command like:
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
Followed by:
sudo firewall-cmd --reload",model_8_answer,"Your instance cannot access the internet because it does not have a Floating IP Address associated with it. By default, instances do not have publicly-accessible IP addresses assigned.

To resolve this issue, you need to associate a Floating IP Address with your instance. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Go to the Network section in the left-hand sidebar and click on Floating IPs.
2. Ensure that there is a free Floating IP available in your project. If not, allocate a new one by clicking the Allocate IP to Project button.
3. Once a Floating IP is allocated to your project, it will display in the list view. Click the Associate button for the Floating IP to assign it to your instance.

20,Complex Query,How can I repeat a networking experiment I found on the Chameleon blog to ensure reproducibility?,"Chameleon provides a complete ecosystem to ensure experiments can be easily reproduced. If an experiment from the blog was packaged for reproducibility, the process would be :   

Find the Artifact on Trovi: The experiment should be packaged as an ""artifact"" on the Trovi sharing portal. This artifact bundles all the necessary components: the Jupyter notebook that orchestrates the experiment, links to the custom disk images containing the required software, and any necessary configuration scripts or data.   

Launch the Jupyter Notebook: From the Trovi page, you can launch the artifact directly into Chameleon's Jupyter environment.

Execute the Notebook: The notebook will contain executable code cells that use Chameleon's Python library (python-chi) to programmatically handle the entire experimental lifecycle. This includes reserving the correct type of hardware, launching instances from the specific custom image, configuring the required networking (e.g., isolated VLANs), running the experiment, and collecting the results.   

Use Daypass for Access (if needed): If you don't have a Chameleon account, the experiment's author can grant you temporary, scoped access to the testbed using the Daypass feature, allowing you to run the artifact and reproduce the results",model_8_answer,"To repeat a networking experiment on Chameleon Cloud for reproducibility, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the experiment**: Find the specific tutorial or blog post that describes the experiment you want to replicate.
2. **Understand the requirements**: Check if the experiment requires any specific hardware or software configurations, and ensure you have access to the necessary resources on Chameleon Cloud.
3. **Clone the repository (if applicable)**: If the experiment is already hosted on GitHub, clone the repository to your local machine or directly to a Node Type on Chameleon Cloud.
4. **Update the hardware query**: If the experiment requires specific node types, update the `hardware query` in step 1 to ensure you're using the correct resources.
5. **Adapt the experiment execution and analysis steps**: Modify the experiment execution and analysis steps (steps 4 and 5) according to your needs and the requirements of the experiment.

To ensure reproducibility, consider packaging your experiment using the Trovi artifact repository, which allows for one-click reproduction of experiments. You can also refer to the Chameleon documentation on practical reproducibility and seek help from the Chameleon community if needed.

1,Factual Recall,What is the purpose of the Chameleon Associate Sites?,"Chameleon Associate Sites are independently-owned and operated hardware resources at other institutions that are integrated into the main Chameleon testbed. Their purpose is twofold:   

For the Chameleon Community: They expand the testbed's scale and hardware diversity, offering unique capabilities not available at the core sites. For example, the site at Northwestern University (CHI@NU) provides nodes with 100G NICs for advanced networking experiments. These resources are available to all Chameleon users through the federated login system.   

For the Host Institution: They provide a turnkey solution for institutions to establish their own research cloud without the high cost and operational overhead of developing the infrastructure from scratch. The central Chameleon team handles user support, system upgrades, and provides a suite of operational tools, allowing the host institution to focus on managing its physical hardware.   

This federation is made possible by CHI-in-a-Box, a distributable software package containing the entire Chameleon infrastructure stack.",model_9_answer,"The purpose of Chameleon Associate Sites is to provide users with access to resources that are similar to those available on the main Chameleon site, but may be subject to temporary unavailability due to other uses. These sites share a common API and federated authentication with the main site, allowing for easy portability of work between them.

Users can find similar resources between sites using the Chameleon Resource Browser, which has been updated with new modules such as the hardware module and storage module. These modules enable users to query hardware availability and storage options more efficiently.

3,How-To,How do I create an isolated network for my instances using the GUI?,"You can create an isolated network, which functions as a private Layer-2 VLAN, through the Chameleon web dashboard. This allows you to run your own network services, like DHCP, without interfering with other users. Here is the step-by-step process :   

Create the Network and Subnet:

Navigate to the Network > Networks page and click the +Create Network button.

In the wizard, give your network a name.

On the Subnet tab, provide a name for the subnet and define its private IP address range in CIDR notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).

On the Subnet Details tab, you can optionally configure DHCP allocation pools and specify DNS servers. Click Create to finish.

Create a Router:

Navigate to the Network > Routers page and click +Create Router.

Give the router a name and click Create Router.

Connect the Router to the Subnet:

On the Routers page, find your new router and click on its name.

Go to the Interfaces tab and click Add Interface.

In the dialog, select the subnet you created in the first step and click Submit.

Your isolated network is now configured and can be attached to instances during launch",model_9_answer,"To create an isolated network for your instances using the GUI:

1. Go to either the **Network Topology** page or the **Networks** page.
2. Click the **+Create Network** button to open the **Create Network** dialog.
3. In the **Create Network** dialog, name your network and make sure you have **Create Subnet** checked. Click the **Next** button.
4. On the **Subnet tab**, specify a **Subnet Name** and a **CIDR Network Address** for your new subnet.
5. To associate this isolated network with an instance, go to the **Network** tab in the instance's configuration page.
6. Select the isolated network you just created (it should be listed under your project's private networks) by clicking on it.

Alternatively, you can create an isolated VLAN Network using the command `openstack network create --provider-network-type vlan --provider-physical-network physnet1 <network_name>`.

**Note:** After creating the isolated network, make sure to configure firewall rules to allow communication between instances within this network.

4,How-To,How do I find and use a pre-configured Jupyter notebook on Chameleon?,"You can find and use pre-configured Jupyter notebooks through Trovi, Chameleon's sharing portal for reproducible experiments.   

Find the Notebook: Navigate to the Trovi portal by selecting ""Trovi"" from the ""Experiment"" dropdown menu on the main Chameleon website. Here you will see a catalog of public ""artifacts,"" which are packaged experiments often containing Jupyter notebooks, scripts, and documentation.   

Use the Notebook: Once you find an artifact you want to use, click the ""Launch on Chameleon"" button. This will open the artifact, including its Jupyter notebook, directly within Chameleon's shared JupyterHub environment, which is accessible to all users with an active project allocation. The notebook will contain the code and instructions needed to replicate the experiment.   ",model_9_answer,"To find and use a pre-configured Jupyter notebook on Chameleon, follow these steps:

First, connect to your instance via an SSH tunnel from your laptop or desktop computer. Once connected, you should see the Jupyter notebook home screen.

Alternatively, you can reserve a Chameleon bare metal node using the Appliance Catalog's JupyterHub appliance. This will provision a node with the JupyterHub application and a Floating IP Address. You can then log in to the JupyterHub server managed by Chameleon using your credentials.

Once logged in, you'll be redirected to your Jupyter Notebook server. If there isn't one allocated for your user yet, it will be created behind the scenes.

Note that the shared Jupyter environment has resource limits (1 CPU core and 1GB of memory), so if you're doing computationally or memory-intensive work, consider using a dedicated Jupyter Server instead.

5,Troubleshooting,"My bare metal node is stuck in the ""deploying"" state for a long time. What should I do?","If a bare metal node remains in the ""deploying"" state for an extended period, it may be experiencing an issue during the boot or provisioning process. The recommended course of action is :   

Wait: The deployment process for a physical node can sometimes take several minutes. It is advisable to wait at least 10-15 minutes to see if the process completes on its own.

Contact Support: If the node is still stuck after this waiting period, you should open a ticket with the Chameleon Help Desk. The operations team can investigate the underlying cause of the deployment failure and resolve the issue. ",model_9_answer,"Given your bare metal node is stuck in the ""deploying"" state for a long time, I recommend checking the instance's output as it boots to see if there are any internal networking or hardware issues. You can do this by accessing the web console during boot-up. If you encounter errors, report them to the help desk along with the observed errors.

Additionally, ensure that you have requested enough nodes in your reservation before starting and keep track of the master node's floating IP address for easier access to the cluster.

If these steps don't resolve the issue, consider waiting for 10-20 minutes after creating your instance as it can take some time for the instance to be running on bare metal resources.

6,Troubleshooting,"I get an ""Error 403: Forbidden"" when trying to use the OpenStack CLI. What's wrong?","An ""Error 403: Forbidden"" when using the OpenStack command-line interface (CLI) is most commonly caused by missing or improperly sourced credentials.   

To use the CLI, you must first authenticate your session. This is done by sourcing an OpenStack RC script (often called a novarc file) in your terminal. This file contains the necessary environment variables (like your username, password, project ID, and authentication URL) that the CLI tools need to communicate with the Chameleon API.

Solution: Ensure you have downloaded your project's OpenStack RC script from the Chameleon dashboard and have sourced it correctly in your terminal session (e.g., by running source your-project-openrc.sh) before executing any other commands.",model_9_answer,"The ""Error 403: Forbidden"" issue when using the OpenStack CLI is likely due to authentication or authorization problems. To troubleshoot this, let's go through the installation and configuration steps.

Firstly, ensure that you have installed the OpenStack Client correctly by running `pip install python-openstackclient` in your terminal. Then, verify its installation by typing `openstack` in your terminal.

For macOS/Linux users, the current terminal session should be configured to access your project. For Windows users, you need to provide environment variables as command parameters when running the `openstack` command.

However, if you're still encountering issues, it's possible that there are problems with your authentication or authorization settings. Check the following:

1. Ensure that your OS_AUTH_URL, OS_PROJECT_ID, OS_PROJECT_NAME, OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME, and OS_USERNAME environment variables are correctly set.
2. Verify that your user has the necessary permissions to access the resources you're trying to interact with.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, it might be helpful to check the OpenStack logs for any error messages that could provide more insight into what's going wrong.

8,Conceptual,"What does it mean for Chameleon to support ""deep reconfigurability""?","""Deep reconfigurability"" is the core design principle of the Chameleon testbed. It means giving researchers an unparalleled level of control over the entire software stack on physical, non-virtualized hardware. This is achieved through several key features:   

Bare Metal Access: Researchers are given exclusive access to entire physical servers, ensuring that experiments are free from the performance interference (""noise"") that can occur in shared or virtualized environments.   

Full Administrative Privileges: Users have root (sudo) access on their reserved nodes. This allows them to install a custom operating system, modify the kernel, change bootloader configurations, and access the machine's serial console.   

This level of control is essential for many areas of computer science systems research where the experiment involves modifying the operating system itself or requires precise, repeatable performance measurements.",model_9_answer,"Deep reconfigurability in Chameleon refers to the ability of the testbed to be extensively customized and reconfigured to meet the specific needs of various computer science experiments. This is achieved through its bare metal reconfigurability feature, which allows users to have direct access to hardware resources without the need for virtualization.

In simpler terms, deep reconfigurability means that Chameleon can be tailored to support a wide range of experimental requirements by adjusting its underlying infrastructure and configuration. This flexibility enables researchers to conduct complex experiments that may not be feasible on traditional cloud or virtualized environments.

9,Comparative,What is the difference between a Floating IP and a Private IP?,"On Chameleon, Private IPs and Floating IPs serve distinct networking purposes :   

Private IP (Fixed IP): This is an IP address assigned to an instance for communication within Chameleon's internal network (e.g., sharednet1). It is not directly reachable from the public internet. Instances use their private IP to communicate with each other and to initiate outbound connections to the internet through a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway.   

Floating IP: This is a publicly routable IPv4 address that can be dynamically associated with an instance. A Floating IP is required for an instance to be directly accessible from the public internet (for example, to connect via SSH from your laptop or to host a public web server). Floating IPs are a limited, shared resource, so users are encouraged to release them when they are no longer needed. ",model_9_answer,"A Floating IP is a public IP address that is associated with an instance in Chameleon Cloud. It allows you to access your instance from outside the cloud, using a public IP address instead of a private one. This is useful for accessing your instance remotely or for exposing services running on your instance to the internet.

On the other hand, a Private IP is an internal IP address assigned to an instance within Chameleon Cloud's network. It is not routable from outside the cloud and is used for communication between instances within the same network.

The key differences between Floating IPs and Private IPs are:

* Accessibility: A Floating IP can be accessed from anywhere on the internet, while a Private IP can only be accessed from within the cloud.
* Routing: A Floating IP is routed through the public internet, while a Private IP is not routable outside the cloud's network.

10,Comparative,When should I use an FPGA node versus a GPU node?,"While the Chameleon documentation does not provide a direct comparison, the choice between an FPGA and a GPU depends on the specific requirements of your research, based on the fundamental differences in their architectures :   

Use a GPU Node for: High-throughput, data-parallel computations. GPUs contain thousands of cores optimized for performing the same operation on large amounts of data simultaneously. This makes them exceptionally well-suited for the matrix and vector operations that dominate deep learning model training and inference, scientific simulations, and high-performance computing (HPC).   

Use an FPGA Node for: Latency-critical or power-sensitive applications requiring custom hardware logic. An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is a fabric of reconfigurable logic blocks, not a fixed set of cores. This allows you to design and implement a custom digital circuit optimized for a specific algorithm. FPGAs can offer advantages in low-latency processing (e.g., network packet processing, real-time signal processing), power efficiency, and for prototyping novel hardware accelerators before committing to a final chip design (ASIC).",model_9_answer,"When deciding between using an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) node versus a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) node on Chameleon Cloud, consider the following factors:

FPGA nodes are suitable when you need to perform custom hardware acceleration or implement specific algorithms that require reconfigurable logic. However, due to their age and software tool support limitations, it's recommended to use Chameleon's Xilinx FPGA nodes instead of Altera ones.

On the other hand, GPU nodes are ideal for applications requiring massive parallel processing power, such as deep learning, scientific simulations, or data analytics. The runtime environment can be set to ""nvidia"" in your container creation call to automatically load the necessary GPU libraries.

If you're unsure about which node type to choose, consider the nature of your application and its computational requirements. If it involves complex algorithms that benefit from reconfigurable logic, an FPGA node might be a better fit. For applications requiring massive parallel processing power, a GPU node is likely more suitable.

13,Factual Recall,What is the maximum duration for a single lease reservation?,"The standard maximum duration for a single lease reservation that can be created through the web interface is seven days.   

However, there is some flexibility. You can extend an active lease for another seven days as long as you do so within 48 hours of its expiration and no other user has already reserved the hardware for that time. In exceptional circumstances where a longer, continuous reservation is required for an experiment, you can open a ticket with the help desk to request a special exception.",model_9_answer,"The maximum duration for a single lease reservation is 7 days. However, an active lease within 48 hours of its end time can be prolonged by up to 7 days from the moment of request if resources are available.

Additionally, it's worth noting that while there isn't a strict limit on prolonging leases beyond the initial 7-day duration, Chameleon actively discourages ""lease stacking"" and encourages users to plan their resource usage accordingly. If a user needs to extend their lease beyond the standard 7 days, they can submit a ticket on the Help Desk to request a one-time exception.

14,Negative Question,Can I use my Chameleon allocation to mine cryptocurrency?,"No, you cannot. Chameleon's Acceptable Use Policy explicitly prohibits running applications that mine cryptocurrency or use blockchain technology for personal financial gain.   

As a publicly funded research instrument supported by the National Science Foundation, Chameleon resources must be used exclusively for research and educational work. Cryptocurrency mining is considered a commercial or personal-gain activity that consumes significant resources and is therefore outside the testbed's mission. An exception may be granted for legitimate    

research into blockchain technology, but this requires advance, explicit approval from the Chameleon team.",model_9_answer,"You cannot use your Chameleon allocation to mine cryptocurrency. According to the provided context, specifically from ""What are the units of an allocation, and how am I charged?"", resources are allocated and charged in Service Units (SUs) which equate to one hour of wall clock time on a base bare metal server. This suggests that allocations are intended for legitimate research purposes, not cryptocurrency mining.

15,Complex Query,How can I set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node?,"Chameleon's support for ""deep reconfigurability"" allows you to install and boot from a custom kernel on a bare metal node. The general process is as follows :   

Launch an Instance: Start by launching an instance from a ""whole disk image."" Most of the standard Chameleon-provided OS images (e.g., CC-Ubuntu20.04) are whole disk images suitable for this purpose.

Install Your Kernel: Once the instance is running, connect to it via SSH. Transfer your custom kernel and its associated modules to the instance and install them.

Modify the Bootloader: With root privileges, edit the bootloader configuration file (e.g., /boot/grub2/grub.cfg). Add a new menu entry that points to your new kernel and ramdisk files. You can also specify any custom kernel command-line parameters in this entry.

Reboot: Reboot the node. It will now boot using your specified custom kernel.

Note that for the cc-snapshot tool to work correctly with your custom environment, the size of your kernel's modules directory (/lib/modules/<kernel_version>) must be less than 4GB. ",model_9_answer,"To set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the required kernel version**: Identify the specific kernel version your experiment needs to run successfully.
2. **Update the hardware query**: If your experiment has specific requirements for the type of node it runs on, update the `hardware query` section in your experiment's configuration to request a bare metal node with the correct kernel version.
3. **Use Trovi for reproducible artifacts**: Utilize Trovi, an open-source service for packaging and sharing reproducible artifacts designed for testbeds, to ensure that your experiment can be easily replicated and run on different nodes.

To update the hardware query, you'll need to modify the `hardware query` section in your experiment's configuration. This may involve specifying the required kernel version or updating other settings as needed.

**Example of updated hardware query:**

```bash
# Update the hardware query to request a bare metal node with the correct kernel version
openstack server create \
  --image <your_image_id> \
  --flavor <your_flavor_id> \
  --nic port-id=<port_id> \

16,Conceptual,What is the Trovi artifacts repository?,"Trovi is Chameleon's sharing portal and repository for digital research artifacts. Its primary purpose is to facilitate    

reproducible science by allowing users to package, share, and discover complete experiments.   

An artifact in Trovi is more than just code; it's a ""compute capsule"" that can contain a collection of components, including :   

Jupyter notebooks that orchestrate the experiment.

Links to the specific custom disk images needed.

Heat orchestration templates for multi-node deployments.

Datasets and documentation.

This packaging allows another researcher to find an experiment on Trovi and, with a single click, launch it directly on Chameleon to verify, replicate, or build upon the work.",model_9_answer,"The Trovi artifacts repository is an open-source service designed for testbeds that allows users to package and share reproducible artifacts. It provides a platform for users to store and manage their artifacts, making them easily accessible and interoperable.

To better understand the purpose of Trovi, let's look at its integration with GitHub. The process involves importing a GitHub repository as a Trovi artifact, which can be done by following these steps:

1. Creating a public GitHub repository: Users need to create a new public repository on GitHub or use an existing one.
2. Generating metadata file: Using the Trovi command line client, users can generate a metadata file that stores information about the artifact.

The Trovi dashboard has been updated with badges for artifacts, indicating whether they are supported by the Chameleon team, reproducible, or educational modules.

17,How-To,How do I launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates?,"You can automate the deployment of complex, multi-node topologies using OpenStack's Heat orchestration service. The process uses a declarative YAML file called a Heat Orchestration Template (HOT).   

Here is the workflow to launch a multi-node ""stack"" :   

Create a Reservation: First, you must have an active lease with enough nodes to accommodate your entire deployment (e.g., if your template defines 1 server and 3 clients, you need a reservation for at least 4 nodes).

Navigate to Orchestration: In the Chameleon dashboard, go to Project > Orchestration > Stacks.

Launch Stack: Click the Launch Stack button.

Select Template: Specify your Heat template. You can upload the YAML file, paste its contents directly, or provide a URL to a template hosted online.

Enter Parameters: The interface will prompt you to enter values for any parameters defined in the template. This will always include a name for the stack, your password, the ID of your reservation, and an SSH key. It may also include custom parameters, like the number of client nodes to create.

Launch: Click Launch. Heat will then automatically provision all the resources—instances, networks, routers, etc.—as defined in your template.",model_9_answer,"To launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates, you can utilize the `OS::Heat::ResourceGroup` resource. This allows you to define a single type of resource and request it to be created any number of times.

Here's an example of how you can modify your template to use `resource groups`. Remove the `nfs_client` and `another_client` resources from your customized template, and replace them with the following:

```yaml
nfs_clients:
  type: OS::Heat::ResourceGroup
  properties:
    count: 2
    resource_def:
      type: OS::Nova::Server
      properties:
        flavor: baremetal
        image: CC-CentOS7
        key_name: { get_param: key_name }
        networks:
          - network: sharednet1
```

This will create two instances of the specified server configuration.

To launch multiple nodes with one command, you can use the `heat stack-create` command. First, ensure that you have an active lease for the nodes. Then, run the following command:

```bash
heat stack-create -f <template_file> --parameter <parameters>
```

Replace `<template_file>` with the path to your Heat template file and `<parameters>` with any required parameters.

For example, if your template is named `network-isolation.yaml` and you want to launch two instances of the `nfs_clients` resource group, you can run:

```bash
heat stack-create -f network-isolation.yaml --parameter key_name=<key_name> --parameter count=2
```

This will create a Heat stack with two instances of the specified server configuration.

18,Factual Recall,Where are the main Chameleon hardware sites located?,"The main physical hardware sites for the Chameleon testbed are :   

CHI@TACC: Located at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) in Austin, Texas. This is the largest site and hosts the bulk of the large-scale compute resources.

CHI@UC: Hosted at the University of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois. This site has a focus on networking research and hosts a diverse range of GPUs and FPGAs.

CHI@NCAR: Situated at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. This site provides access to alternative processor architectures, such as ARM.

19,Troubleshooting,"Why can't my instance access the internet, even with a floating IP?","The most common reason an instance with a floating IP cannot be accessed from the internet is due to the host-based firewall running on the instance itself.   

Chameleon's supported operating system images (like Ubuntu and CentOS) are pre-configured with firewalld enabled by default for security. This firewall has restrictive rules that block most incoming connections from the public internet.   

To solve this, you must connect to your instance (e.g., via the web-based console) and explicitly open the ports for the services you need. For example, to allow incoming HTTP traffic, you would run a command like:
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
Followed by:
sudo firewall-cmd --reload",model_9_answer,"Your instance cannot access the internet because it does not have a floating IP address associated with it. A floating IP is required to allow external connections to your instance. You can attach a floating IP to your instance using the `openstack_compute_floatingip_associate_v2` resource.

However, if you're still unable to access the internet, there could be other issues such as DHCP failure or network unreachable errors. In this case, try running `sudo dhclient` on the instance to trigger the DHCP client IP discovery.

It's also worth noting that exposing your instance directly to the open internet is not recommended. Instead, consider using a secure and encrypted tunnel like SSH for accessing your services remotely.

20,Complex Query,How can I repeat a networking experiment I found on the Chameleon blog to ensure reproducibility?,"Chameleon provides a complete ecosystem to ensure experiments can be easily reproduced. If an experiment from the blog was packaged for reproducibility, the process would be :   

Find the Artifact on Trovi: The experiment should be packaged as an ""artifact"" on the Trovi sharing portal. This artifact bundles all the necessary components: the Jupyter notebook that orchestrates the experiment, links to the custom disk images containing the required software, and any necessary configuration scripts or data.   

Launch the Jupyter Notebook: From the Trovi page, you can launch the artifact directly into Chameleon's Jupyter environment.

Execute the Notebook: The notebook will contain executable code cells that use Chameleon's Python library (python-chi) to programmatically handle the entire experimental lifecycle. This includes reserving the correct type of hardware, launching instances from the specific custom image, configuring the required networking (e.g., isolated VLANs), running the experiment, and collecting the results.   

Use Daypass for Access (if needed): If you don't have a Chameleon account, the experiment's author can grant you temporary, scoped access to the testbed using the Daypass feature, allowing you to run the artifact and reproduce the results",model_9_answer,"To repeat a networking experiment on Chameleon and ensure reproducibility, follow these steps:

First, navigate to the Trovi sharing portal where you can find packaged experimental environments that have been shared by other users. This will give you access to pre-configured experiments that you can easily replicate.

Next, identify the specific experiment you want to repeat and click on it in Trovi. You'll be taken to a page with detailed information about the experiment, including its configuration and setup.

To create your own reproducible version of the experiment, follow these steps:

1. Click on the ""Create Experiment"" button in Trovi.
2. Select the experiment you want to repeat from the list of available experiments.
3. Choose the resources you need for your experiment, such as nodes, networks, and storage.
4. Configure any additional settings or parameters required by your experiment.

Once you've created your reproducible version of the experiment, you can run it on Chameleon's infrastructure. To ensure that your experiment is truly reproducible, make sure to document every step of the process, including any configuration changes or parameter tweaks.

1,Factual Recall,What is the purpose of the Chameleon Associate Sites?,"Chameleon Associate Sites are independently-owned and operated hardware resources at other institutions that are integrated into the main Chameleon testbed. Their purpose is twofold:   

For the Chameleon Community: They expand the testbed's scale and hardware diversity, offering unique capabilities not available at the core sites. For example, the site at Northwestern University (CHI@NU) provides nodes with 100G NICs for advanced networking experiments. These resources are available to all Chameleon users through the federated login system.   

For the Host Institution: They provide a turnkey solution for institutions to establish their own research cloud without the high cost and operational overhead of developing the infrastructure from scratch. The central Chameleon team handles user support, system upgrades, and provides a suite of operational tools, allowing the host institution to focus on managing its physical hardware.   

This federation is made possible by CHI-in-a-Box, a distributable software package containing the entire Chameleon infrastructure stack.",model_10_answer,"The purpose of Chameleon Associate Sites is to provide users with access to different testbed sites, each with its own set of resources and capabilities. By selecting a site from the dropdown menu in the ""Experiment"" tab, users can switch between different sites, such as CHI@UC or CHI@TACC, depending on their needs.

Each site has its own dashboard that displays a summary of the project's current resource usage, allowing users to monitor and manage their resources across multiple sites. Additionally, users can reserve nodes, create leases, and manage their projects and users across different sites using the Reservations Dashboard and other tools provided by Chameleon.

By having access to multiple associate sites, users can take advantage of different hardware configurations, network topologies, and other features that may not be available on a single site. This flexibility allows researchers and developers to conduct experiments and tests in a more realistic and scalable environment, which is particularly useful for large-scale distributed systems and cloud computing applications.

3,How-To,How do I create an isolated network for my instances using the GUI?,"You can create an isolated network, which functions as a private Layer-2 VLAN, through the Chameleon web dashboard. This allows you to run your own network services, like DHCP, without interfering with other users. Here is the step-by-step process :   

Create the Network and Subnet:

Navigate to the Network > Networks page and click the +Create Network button.

In the wizard, give your network a name.

On the Subnet tab, provide a name for the subnet and define its private IP address range in CIDR notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).

On the Subnet Details tab, you can optionally configure DHCP allocation pools and specify DNS servers. Click Create to finish.

Create a Router:

Navigate to the Network > Routers page and click +Create Router.

Give the router a name and click Create Router.

Connect the Router to the Subnet:

On the Routers page, find your new router and click on its name.

Go to the Interfaces tab and click Add Interface.

In the dialog, select the subnet you created in the first step and click Submit.

Your isolated network is now configured and can be attached to instances during launch",model_10_answer,"To create an isolated network for your instances using the GUI:

First, go to the ""Networks"" page and delete any existing networks that you don't need by clicking on the dropdown in the ""Action"" column and selecting ""Delete Network"". Alternatively, you can select the network using the checkbox and click on the ""Delete Networks"" button on the upper right corner.

Next, create a new isolated VLAN network. To do this, go to the ""Networks"" page and click on the ""+""Create Network"" button to open the ""Create Network"" dialog. Name your network and make sure you have ""Create Subnet"" checked. Click the ""Next"" button.

In the ""Subnet"" tab, specify a subnet name and a CIDR network address that contains a private IP address and a subnet mask length. For example, you can create a Class C subnet with a 24-bit mask by entering ""192.168.1.0/24"". You may set a gateway or leave it blank to use the default.

In the ""Subnet details"" section, specify DHCP and static route information as needed. Allocation pools allow you to specify DHCP address ranges in the format of ""<first address>,<last address>"". For example, entering ""192.168.1.2,192.168.1.100"" will create a subnet with IP ranges from ""192.168.1.2"" to ""192.168.1.100"".

5,Troubleshooting,"My bare metal node is stuck in the ""deploying"" state for a long time. What should I do?","If a bare metal node remains in the ""deploying"" state for an extended period, it may be experiencing an issue during the boot or provisioning process. The recommended course of action is :   

Wait: The deployment process for a physical node can sometimes take several minutes. It is advisable to wait at least 10-15 minutes to see if the process completes on its own.

Contact Support: If the node is still stuck after this waiting period, you should open a ticket with the Chameleon Help Desk. The operations team can investigate the underlying cause of the deployment failure and resolve the issue. ",model_10_answer,"Based on your context, it seems like you're experiencing issues with your bare metal node being stuck in the ""deploying"" state for a long time. I'll provide some potential solutions and troubleshooting steps.

Firstly, ensure that your device has connectivity to the internet and can successfully connect to balena or chi@edge's servers. This is crucial for the k3s worker to start up and move the status to 3/4.

If you've already checked the internet connection and it's healthy, then there might be a misconfiguration on our side giving an old config to PI5s, as mentioned in your context. In this case, try checking the lease details for any potential issues or errors.

To troubleshoot further, I recommend reviewing the ""Leases"" screen and ensuring that you have an active lease for the nodes. You can also check the ""Hosts"" tab to verify if there are any issues with reserving hosts.

Additionally, consider using the command `openstack stack resource show <stack_uuid> <resource_name>` to retrieve information about a specific resource. This might help identify any potential problems or errors.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, it's possible that there's an underlying problem with your configuration or setup. In this case, I recommend reaching out to our support team for further assistance.

6,Troubleshooting,"I get an ""Error 403: Forbidden"" when trying to use the OpenStack CLI. What's wrong?","An ""Error 403: Forbidden"" when using the OpenStack command-line interface (CLI) is most commonly caused by missing or improperly sourced credentials.   

To use the CLI, you must first authenticate your session. This is done by sourcing an OpenStack RC script (often called a novarc file) in your terminal. This file contains the necessary environment variables (like your username, password, project ID, and authentication URL) that the CLI tools need to communicate with the Chameleon API.

Solution: Ensure you have downloaded your project's OpenStack RC script from the Chameleon dashboard and have sourced it correctly in your terminal session (e.g., by running source your-project-openrc.sh) before executing any other commands.",model_10_answer,"The ""Error 403: Forbidden"" when using the OpenStack CLI is typically caused by authentication issues or incorrect configuration.

To troubleshoot this issue, let's go through some steps:

1. **Verify your credentials**: Ensure that you have entered the correct username, password, and project name in the OpenStack RC script.
2. **Check the OpenStack RC script**: Make sure that the `openrc` file is correctly sourced before running any OpenStack commands. You can do this by running `source /path/to/openrc.sh` or `source /path/to/openrc.csh`.
3. **Verify the authentication API version**: Ensure that you are using the correct authentication API version. In your case, it seems like you're using v2.0, but some OpenStack services might require v3. You can check this by running `openstack --os-identity-api-version 3 <command>`.
4. **Check for permission issues**: If you have permission errors, ensure that the terminal session has been configured correctly with the environment variables and that the OpenStack RC script is sourced.

Based on your context, it seems like you've already tried sourcing the `openrc` file and entering your password correctly. However, you're still getting a 401 error.

To further troubleshoot this issue, I would recommend checking the OpenStack logs for any errors related to authentication or authorization. You can do this by running `openstack --debug <command>`, which will provide more detailed output about what's going on during the authentication process.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, it might be worth reaching out to the Chameleon Cloud support team for further assistance.

7,Conceptual,"What is ""CHI-in-a-Box""?","CHI-in-a-Box is a distributable software package that contains the complete, containerized infrastructure stack that powers the Chameleon testbed. It bundles the open-source cloud platform OpenStack with all of the Chameleon-specific customizations and operational tools needed to run a research-oriented cloud.   

These customizations include features not found in a standard OpenStack installation, such as bare metal snapshotting, network stitching for connecting to other testbeds, and advanced hardware reservation capabilities. CHI-in-a-Box is the technology that enables other institutions to set up their own Chameleon Associate Sites, allowing them to join the federated testbed without having to develop their own complex cloud software from scratch",model_10_answer,"CHI-in-a-box is a packaging of the implementation of the core services that together constitute the Chameleon testbed for experimental Computer Science research. These services allow Chameleon users to discover information, reserve resources, and launch instances.

The CHI-in-a-box updates for image deployment include an image-deployer tool that associate site operators can run to fetch updated images from our flagship sites. This tool allows for automatic management of image versions in the background or manual pulling of image updates.

8,Conceptual,"What does it mean for Chameleon to support ""deep reconfigurability""?","""Deep reconfigurability"" is the core design principle of the Chameleon testbed. It means giving researchers an unparalleled level of control over the entire software stack on physical, non-virtualized hardware. This is achieved through several key features:   

Bare Metal Access: Researchers are given exclusive access to entire physical servers, ensuring that experiments are free from the performance interference (""noise"") that can occur in shared or virtualized environments.   

Full Administrative Privileges: Users have root (sudo) access on their reserved nodes. This allows them to install a custom operating system, modify the kernel, change bootloader configurations, and access the machine's serial console.   

This level of control is essential for many areas of computer science systems research where the experiment involves modifying the operating system itself or requires precise, repeatable performance measurements.",model_10_answer,"Deep reconfigurability in Chameleon refers to its ability to dynamically change and adapt its infrastructure to meet the needs of various research projects. This is achieved through a combination of software-defined networking (SDN) and software-defined storage (SDS), which allows for flexible and on-demand allocation of resources.

Chameleon's deep reconfigurability enables researchers to easily deploy, manage, and scale their experiments without requiring extensive IT expertise or manual intervention from administrators. This flexibility is particularly useful in high-performance computing (HPC) environments where resource requirements can be unpredictable and dynamic.

The Chameleon team has been actively working on improving its services, including the introduction of new hardware features such as composable systems with flexible GPU configurations, and upgrading existing infrastructure to support more recent OpenStack versions. These efforts aim to provide researchers with a more efficient and effective way to conduct their experiments.

9,Comparative,What is the difference between a Floating IP and a Private IP?,"On Chameleon, Private IPs and Floating IPs serve distinct networking purposes :   

Private IP (Fixed IP): This is an IP address assigned to an instance for communication within Chameleon's internal network (e.g., sharednet1). It is not directly reachable from the public internet. Instances use their private IP to communicate with each other and to initiate outbound connections to the internet through a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway.   

Floating IP: This is a publicly routable IPv4 address that can be dynamically associated with an instance. A Floating IP is required for an instance to be directly accessible from the public internet (for example, to connect via SSH from your laptop or to host a public web server). Floating IPs are a limited, shared resource, so users are encouraged to release them when they are no longer needed. ",model_10_answer,"A Floating IP is a public IP address that can be associated with an instance, allowing it to be accessed directly over the public Internet. It is a shared and finite resource, and users are encouraged to release any unused floating IPs to make them available for other projects.

On the other hand, a Private IP is a private IP address assigned to an instance within a project's network. It is not accessible from outside the project's network and is used for communication between instances within the same project.

The key differences between Floating IPs and Private IPs are:

* Accessibility: Floating IPs can be accessed directly over the public Internet, while Private IPs are only accessible within the project's network.
* Sharing: Floating IPs are shared among projects, while Private IPs are unique to each instance within a project.
* Purpose: Floating IPs are used for accessing instances from outside the project's network, while Private IPs are used for communication between instances within the same project.

10,Comparative,When should I use an FPGA node versus a GPU node?,"While the Chameleon documentation does not provide a direct comparison, the choice between an FPGA and a GPU depends on the specific requirements of your research, based on the fundamental differences in their architectures :   

Use a GPU Node for: High-throughput, data-parallel computations. GPUs contain thousands of cores optimized for performing the same operation on large amounts of data simultaneously. This makes them exceptionally well-suited for the matrix and vector operations that dominate deep learning model training and inference, scientific simulations, and high-performance computing (HPC).   

Use an FPGA Node for: Latency-critical or power-sensitive applications requiring custom hardware logic. An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is a fabric of reconfigurable logic blocks, not a fixed set of cores. This allows you to design and implement a custom digital circuit optimized for a specific algorithm. FPGAs can offer advantages in low-latency processing (e.g., network packet processing, real-time signal processing), power efficiency, and for prototyping novel hardware accelerators before committing to a final chip design (ASIC).",model_10_answer,"When deciding between an FPGA node and a GPU node on Chameleon Cloud, consider the following factors:

1. **Compute-intensive tasks**: If you have applications that require massive parallel processing, such as deep learning or scientific simulations, FPGAs are more suitable due to their ability to accelerate specific workloads.
2. **Customizable hardware**: FPGAs offer reconfigurability and can be programmed to perform custom operations, making them ideal for applications with unique requirements.
3. **Low latency**: FPGAs typically provide lower latency compared to GPUs, which is beneficial for real-time processing or applications requiring fast data transfer.

On the other hand:

1. **General-purpose computing**: For general-purpose computing tasks, such as data analytics or machine learning, GPUs are often a better choice due to their high memory bandwidth and parallel processing capabilities.
2. **Off-the-shelf solutions**: If you need to run pre-existing software or frameworks that are optimized for GPUs, it's more convenient to use a GPU node.

To summarize:

* Use an FPGA node when:
	+ You have compute-intensive tasks with specific acceleration requirements.
	+ Customizable hardware is necessary.
	+ Low latency is critical.
* Use a GPU node when:
	+ General-purpose computing tasks are involved.
	+ Off-the-shelf solutions or pre-existing software optimized for GPUs are required.

14,Negative Question,Can I use my Chameleon allocation to mine cryptocurrency?,"No, you cannot. Chameleon's Acceptable Use Policy explicitly prohibits running applications that mine cryptocurrency or use blockchain technology for personal financial gain.   

As a publicly funded research instrument supported by the National Science Foundation, Chameleon resources must be used exclusively for research and educational work. Cryptocurrency mining is considered a commercial or personal-gain activity that consumes significant resources and is therefore outside the testbed's mission. An exception may be granted for legitimate    

research into blockchain technology, but this requires advance, explicit approval from the Chameleon team.",model_10_answer,"You cannot use your Chameleon allocation to mine cryptocurrency due to the policies and monitoring in place to ensure fair usage of resources.

The provided context mentions that Chameleon monitors usage to prevent ""stacking"" leases, which is a behavior where one project unreasonably hoards resources by making multiple leases. This policy update aims to ensure that everybody can get a chance to use the hardware, particularly affecting highly demanded GPU nodes. While this behavior is rare, repeated offenses may result in lease termination.

Additionally, the context does not mention any specific features or tools within Chameleon that would facilitate cryptocurrency mining. The focus of Chameleon seems to be on providing a testbed for computer science research and education, rather than supporting activities like cryptocurrency mining.

15,Complex Query,How can I set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node?,"Chameleon's support for ""deep reconfigurability"" allows you to install and boot from a custom kernel on a bare metal node. The general process is as follows :   

Launch an Instance: Start by launching an instance from a ""whole disk image."" Most of the standard Chameleon-provided OS images (e.g., CC-Ubuntu20.04) are whole disk images suitable for this purpose.

Install Your Kernel: Once the instance is running, connect to it via SSH. Transfer your custom kernel and its associated modules to the instance and install them.

Modify the Bootloader: With root privileges, edit the bootloader configuration file (e.g., /boot/grub2/grub.cfg). Add a new menu entry that points to your new kernel and ramdisk files. You can also specify any custom kernel command-line parameters in this entry.

Reboot: Reboot the node. It will now boot using your specified custom kernel.

Note that for the cc-snapshot tool to work correctly with your custom environment, the size of your kernel's modules directory (/lib/modules/<kernel_version>) must be less than 4GB. ",model_10_answer,"To set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node, you can follow these steps:

First, ensure that your experiment is already on GitHub. If it's not, create a new repository and commit your changes.

Next, fork the updated Bare Metal Experiment Pattern Trovi Artifact (GitHub) to get started with Python-chi 1.0. This will provide you with a streamlined example of how to set up an experiment using Python-chi.

Once you have the artifact, follow the five steps outlined in the documentation:

1. Query resources and make a lease.
2. Provision a single node (in this case, a bare metal node).
3. Copy experiment files and install dependencies.
4. Run the experiment and upload the data.
5. Analyze data.

To reserve a specific kernel version on a bare metal node, you can use the `resource_properties` argument when creating a lease. For example, to reserve a node with a specific kernel version, you would use:

```
resource_properties='[""="",
""$kernel_version"",
""<specific_kernel_version>""]'
```

Replace `<specific_kernel_version>` with the actual kernel version required for your experiment.

After reserving the node, you can provision it and copy your experiment files to the node. Finally, run your experiment and upload the data as per the documentation.

Note that if your experiment requires a specific hardware configuration or topology, you may need to adapt the `hardware query` in step 1 and the experiment execution and analysis steps (4 and 5) accordingly.

17,How-To,How do I launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates?,"You can automate the deployment of complex, multi-node topologies using OpenStack's Heat orchestration service. The process uses a declarative YAML file called a Heat Orchestration Template (HOT).   

Here is the workflow to launch a multi-node ""stack"" :   

Create a Reservation: First, you must have an active lease with enough nodes to accommodate your entire deployment (e.g., if your template defines 1 server and 3 clients, you need a reservation for at least 4 nodes).

Navigate to Orchestration: In the Chameleon dashboard, go to Project > Orchestration > Stacks.

Launch Stack: Click the Launch Stack button.

Select Template: Specify your Heat template. You can upload the YAML file, paste its contents directly, or provide a URL to a template hosted online.

Enter Parameters: The interface will prompt you to enter values for any parameters defined in the template. This will always include a name for the stack, your password, the ID of your reservation, and an SSH key. It may also include custom parameters, like the number of client nodes to create.

Launch: Click Launch. Heat will then automatically provision all the resources—instances, networks, routers, etc.—as defined in your template.",model_10_answer,"To launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates, you need to leverage resource groups. A resource group is a construct from Heat that allows you to define one kind of resource and request it to be created any number of times.

Here's an example of how to modify your template to use resource groups:

1. Remove the `nfs_client` and `another_client` resources from your customized template.
2. Replace them with the following code:
```yml
nfs_clients:
  type: OS::Heat::ResourceGroup
  properties:
    count: 2
    resource_def:
      type: OS::Nova::Server
      properties:
        flavor: baremetal
        image: CC-CentOS7
        key_name: { get_param: key_name }
        networks:
          - network: sharednet1
        scheduler_hints: { reservation: { get_param: reservation_id } }
        user_data:
          str_replace:
            template: |
              #!/bin/bash
              yum install -y nfs-utils
              echo ""$nfs_server_ip:/exports/example    /mnt/    nfs"" > /etc/fstab
              mount -a
            params:
              $nfs_server_ip: { get_attr: [nfs_server, first_address] }
```
In this example, `nfs_clients` is a resource group that defines two servers with the same properties. The `count` property specifies that you want to launch 2 instances.

You can adjust the number of instances by changing the value of the `count` property.

After modifying your template, you can launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates.

19,Troubleshooting,"Why can't my instance access the internet, even with a floating IP?","The most common reason an instance with a floating IP cannot be accessed from the internet is due to the host-based firewall running on the instance itself.   

Chameleon's supported operating system images (like Ubuntu and CentOS) are pre-configured with firewalld enabled by default for security. This firewall has restrictive rules that block most incoming connections from the public internet.   

To solve this, you must connect to your instance (e.g., via the web-based console) and explicitly open the ports for the services you need. For example, to allow incoming HTTP traffic, you would run a command like:
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
Followed by:
sudo firewall-cmd --reload",model_10_answer,"Your instance can't access the internet because it's stuck at step 2/4 of the boot process. This usually means that your device doesn‚Äôt have connectivity to the internet, and via the internet to balena or chi@edge‚Äôs servers.

However, in this particular case, the issue was a misconfiguration on our side giving an old config to PI5s, so the k3s worker never started even though the internet connection was healthy. 

To troubleshoot this issue, you can check if your instance has connectivity to the internet by trying to SSH into it using the Floating IP address and private key. If you get errors such as ""connection refused"" or ""failures to accept your key"", it's likely that the physical node is still going through the boot process. In that case, wait before retrying.

20,Complex Query,How can I repeat a networking experiment I found on the Chameleon blog to ensure reproducibility?,"Chameleon provides a complete ecosystem to ensure experiments can be easily reproduced. If an experiment from the blog was packaged for reproducibility, the process would be :   

Find the Artifact on Trovi: The experiment should be packaged as an ""artifact"" on the Trovi sharing portal. This artifact bundles all the necessary components: the Jupyter notebook that orchestrates the experiment, links to the custom disk images containing the required software, and any necessary configuration scripts or data.   

Launch the Jupyter Notebook: From the Trovi page, you can launch the artifact directly into Chameleon's Jupyter environment.

Execute the Notebook: The notebook will contain executable code cells that use Chameleon's Python library (python-chi) to programmatically handle the entire experimental lifecycle. This includes reserving the correct type of hardware, launching instances from the specific custom image, configuring the required networking (e.g., isolated VLANs), running the experiment, and collecting the results.   

Use Daypass for Access (if needed): If you don't have a Chameleon account, the experiment's author can grant you temporary, scoped access to the testbed using the Daypass feature, allowing you to run the artifact and reproduce the results",model_10_answer,"To repeat a networking experiment found on the Chameleon blog and ensure reproducibility, follow these steps:

1. **Find the experiment**: Identify the specific experiment you want to replicate from the Chameleon blog. You can search for experiments by keyword or browse through the tutorials on Trovi.
2. **Package artifacts**: Use the Trovi artifact repository to package the necessary artifacts for your experiment. This will allow you to share and run the experiment with one-click reproducibility.
3. **Check the documentation**: Review the Chameleon documentation, especially the section on networking experiments, which covers isolated VLANs, layer 2 stitching, and software-defined networking.
4. **Understand the networking backend**: Familiarize yourself with the wireguard tunnel backend, which allows you to send traffic between containers on different devices, even in different locations.
5. **Set up a bastion host (optional)**: Consider setting up a bastion host to connect to several nodes while only needing one floating IP.
6. **Reserve addresses and set up leases**: Make sure to reserve the necessary addresses and set up leases for your experiment.
7. **Run the experiment**: Use the packaged artifacts and configured environment to run the experiment.

To ensure reproducibility, follow the principles of practical reproducibility mentioned in the Chameleon changelog:

8,Conceptual,"What does it mean for Chameleon to support ""deep reconfigurability""?","""Deep reconfigurability"" is the core design principle of the Chameleon testbed. It means giving researchers an unparalleled level of control over the entire software stack on physical, non-virtualized hardware. This is achieved through several key features:   

Bare Metal Access: Researchers are given exclusive access to entire physical servers, ensuring that experiments are free from the performance interference (""noise"") that can occur in shared or virtualized environments.   

Full Administrative Privileges: Users have root (sudo) access on their reserved nodes. This allows them to install a custom operating system, modify the kernel, change bootloader configurations, and access the machine's serial console.   

This level of control is essential for many areas of computer science systems research where the experiment involves modifying the operating system itself or requires precise, repeatable performance measurements.",base_ollama_model_answer,"Chameleon supports ""deep reconfigurability"" which means that its hardware can be dynamically reconfigured at multiple levels, from individual components to entire system architectures. This allows users to adapt the infrastructure to changing workloads and applications without requiring physical changes or downtime. The reconfiguration process is automated through software interfaces, enabling rapid deployment of new services and applications. Deep reconfigurability also enables experimentation with novel network topologies and protocols.

9,Comparative,What is the difference between a Floating IP and a Private IP?,"On Chameleon, Private IPs and Floating IPs serve distinct networking purposes :   

Private IP (Fixed IP): This is an IP address assigned to an instance for communication within Chameleon's internal network (e.g., sharednet1). It is not directly reachable from the public internet. Instances use their private IP to communicate with each other and to initiate outbound connections to the internet through a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway.   

Floating IP: This is a publicly routable IPv4 address that can be dynamically associated with an instance. A Floating IP is required for an instance to be directly accessible from the public internet (for example, to connect via SSH from your laptop or to host a public web server). Floating IPs are a limited, shared resource, so users are encouraged to release them when they are no longer needed. ",base_ollama_model_answer,"In Chameleon Cloud, a Floating IP (Floating IP Address) is an external IP address that can be associated with any instance in your project, allowing you to access it from outside the cloud. A Private IP, on the other hand, is an internal IP address assigned to an instance and is only accessible within the cloud.

A key difference between the two is that a Floating IP can be changed at any time, while a Private IP remains fixed for the lifetime of the instance. This allows you to easily move instances between different networks or projects without having to reconfigure their connections.",0.24166666666666667,0.8199993968009949,0.1891891891891892,0.5571613871902892
10,Comparative,When should I use an FPGA node versus a GPU node?,"While the Chameleon documentation does not provide a direct comparison, the choice between an FPGA and a GPU depends on the specific requirements of your research, based on the fundamental differences in their architectures :   

Use a GPU Node for: High-throughput, data-parallel computations. GPUs contain thousands of cores optimized for performing the same operation on large amounts of data simultaneously. This makes them exceptionally well-suited for the matrix and vector operations that dominate deep learning model training and inference, scientific simulations, and high-performance computing (HPC).   

Use an FPGA Node for: Latency-critical or power-sensitive applications requiring custom hardware logic. An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is a fabric of reconfigurable logic blocks, not a fixed set of cores. This allows you to design and implement a custom digital circuit optimized for a specific algorithm. FPGAs can offer advantages in low-latency processing (e.g., network packet processing, real-time signal processing), power efficiency, and for prototyping novel hardware accelerators before committing to a final chip design (ASIC).",base_ollama_model_answer,"For computationally intensive tasks, consider using a GPU node for applications like deep learning, data analytics, or scientific simulations that benefit from parallel processing. FPGA nodes are better suited for tasks requiring custom hardware acceleration, such as cryptographic operations, network packet processing, or high-speed data compression. If your application requires both flexibility and performance, an FPGA node might be the best choice. GPU nodes typically offer higher memory capacity and a wider range of libraries, making them suitable for large-scale computations.

19,Troubleshooting,"Why can't my instance access the internet, even with a floating IP?","The most common reason an instance with a floating IP cannot be accessed from the internet is due to the host-based firewall running on the instance itself.   

Chameleon's supported operating system images (like Ubuntu and CentOS) are pre-configured with firewalld enabled by default for security. This firewall has restrictive rules that block most incoming connections from the public internet.   

To solve this, you must connect to your instance (e.g., via the web-based console) and explicitly open the ports for the services you need. For example, to allow incoming HTTP traffic, you would run a command like:
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
Followed by:
sudo firewall-cmd --reload",base_ollama_model_answer,"This issue is likely due to security groups not being configured correctly. Ensure that your instance's security group allows incoming traffic on port 22 (SSH) or other necessary ports. Also, check if the floating IP is associated with the correct security group.

20,Complex Query,How can I repeat a networking experiment I found on the Chameleon blog to ensure reproducibility?,"Chameleon provides a complete ecosystem to ensure experiments can be easily reproduced. If an experiment from the blog was packaged for reproducibility, the process would be :   

Find the Artifact on Trovi: The experiment should be packaged as an ""artifact"" on the Trovi sharing portal. This artifact bundles all the necessary components: the Jupyter notebook that orchestrates the experiment, links to the custom disk images containing the required software, and any necessary configuration scripts or data.   

Launch the Jupyter Notebook: From the Trovi page, you can launch the artifact directly into Chameleon's Jupyter environment.

Execute the Notebook: The notebook will contain executable code cells that use Chameleon's Python library (python-chi) to programmatically handle the entire experimental lifecycle. This includes reserving the correct type of hardware, launching instances from the specific custom image, configuring the required networking (e.g., isolated VLANs), running the experiment, and collecting the results.   

Use Daypass for Access (if needed): If you don't have a Chameleon account, the experiment's author can grant you temporary, scoped access to the testbed using the Daypass feature, allowing you to run the artifact and reproduce the results",base_ollama_model_answer,"To repeat a networking experiment from the Chameleon blog, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Chameleon dashboard and navigate to the ""Experiments"" tab.
2. Click on the ""Clone Experiment"" button next to the experiment you want to repeat.
3. Fill in any necessary details for the cloned experiment, such as the number of nodes or duration.

1,Factual Recall,What is the purpose of the Chameleon Associate Sites?,"Chameleon Associate Sites are independently-owned and operated hardware resources at other institutions that are integrated into the main Chameleon testbed. Their purpose is twofold:   

For the Chameleon Community: They expand the testbed's scale and hardware diversity, offering unique capabilities not available at the core sites. For example, the site at Northwestern University (CHI@NU) provides nodes with 100G NICs for advanced networking experiments. These resources are available to all Chameleon users through the federated login system.   

For the Host Institution: They provide a turnkey solution for institutions to establish their own research cloud without the high cost and operational overhead of developing the infrastructure from scratch. The central Chameleon team handles user support, system upgrades, and provides a suite of operational tools, allowing the host institution to focus on managing its physical hardware.   

This federation is made possible by CHI-in-a-Box, a distributable software package containing the entire Chameleon infrastructure stack.",model_11_answer,"The Chameleon Associate Sites are designed to allow providers to add resources to the Chameleon testbed while retaining their own project identity. This means that they can provide system administration of their resources, use the Chameleon user services, and have access to the user portal, resource discovery, and appliance catalog. The Chameleon team will still provide all user support.

5,Troubleshooting,"My bare metal node is stuck in the ""deploying"" state for a long time. What should I do?","If a bare metal node remains in the ""deploying"" state for an extended period, it may be experiencing an issue during the boot or provisioning process. The recommended course of action is :   

Wait: The deployment process for a physical node can sometimes take several minutes. It is advisable to wait at least 10-15 minutes to see if the process completes on its own.

Contact Support: If the node is still stuck after this waiting period, you should open a ticket with the Chameleon Help Desk. The operations team can investigate the underlying cause of the deployment failure and resolve the issue. ",model_11_answer,"If your bare metal node is stuck in the ""deploying"" state for a long time, it's likely due to one of several reasons:

1. **Reservation issues**: Make sure you have created a lease with physical nodes and that it has started (the associated reservation is shown as 'Active'). Also, ensure that you have selected your reservation in the Launch Instance panel.
2. **Over-used reservation**: Be aware that Chameleon Bare Metal clouds require users to reserve resources before allowing them to launch instances. If you're over-using your reservation, it may cause issues with launching new instances.
3. **Security group settings**: Check if your security group allows incoming SSH (TCP port 22) traffic. By default, firewall rules do not allow SSH to your instances.

To troubleshoot the issue:

1. Check the Chameleon portal for any error messages or notifications related to your instance.
2. Verify that you have sufficient resources available in your reservation.
3. Review your security group settings and ensure they are correctly configured.
4. If none of these steps resolve the issue, open a ticket with our help desk, providing them with the results of the above checks.

6,Troubleshooting,"I get an ""Error 403: Forbidden"" when trying to use the OpenStack CLI. What's wrong?","An ""Error 403: Forbidden"" when using the OpenStack command-line interface (CLI) is most commonly caused by missing or improperly sourced credentials.   

To use the CLI, you must first authenticate your session. This is done by sourcing an OpenStack RC script (often called a novarc file) in your terminal. This file contains the necessary environment variables (like your username, password, project ID, and authentication URL) that the CLI tools need to communicate with the Chameleon API.

Solution: Ensure you have downloaded your project's OpenStack RC script from the Chameleon dashboard and have sourced it correctly in your terminal session (e.g., by running source your-project-openrc.sh) before executing any other commands.",model_11_answer,"The error ""Error 403: Forbidden"" typically indicates that you do not have permission to access a particular resource or perform a specific action in OpenStack.

To troubleshoot this issue, let's go through some common causes and solutions:

1. **Authentication**: Ensure that you are properly authenticated with your Chameleon account credentials. You can check if your authentication is correct by running the command `openstack --os-username <your_username> --os-password <your_password> --os-project-name <your_project_name> token show`. If this command fails, it may indicate an issue with your authentication.
2. **Project selection**: Verify that you are using the correct project name and ID in your OpenStack commands. You can list all projects by running `openstack project list` and then select the correct project using `openstack --os-project-name <project_name>`.
3. **Role and permissions**: Check if your user has the necessary roles and permissions to access the resources you are trying to manage. You can check your role and permissions by running `openstack role list` and `openstack role assignment list`.
4. **API version**: Ensure that you are using the correct API version for the OpenStack service you are interacting with. You can specify the API version using the `--os-share-api-version` option, as mentioned in the documentation.

To resolve the issue, try the following:

* Check your authentication and project selection.
* Verify your role and permissions.
* Try specifying the API version if you suspect it's related to this issue.
* If none of these solutions work, try resetting your OpenStack environment variables using `unset OS_USERNAME` and then re-authenticate.

If you're still experiencing issues after trying these steps, please refer to the Chameleon documentation or contact their support team for further assistance.

7,Conceptual,"What is ""CHI-in-a-Box""?","CHI-in-a-Box is a distributable software package that contains the complete, containerized infrastructure stack that powers the Chameleon testbed. It bundles the open-source cloud platform OpenStack with all of the Chameleon-specific customizations and operational tools needed to run a research-oriented cloud.   

These customizations include features not found in a standard OpenStack installation, such as bare metal snapshotting, network stitching for connecting to other testbeds, and advanced hardware reservation capabilities. CHI-in-a-Box is the technology that enables other institutions to set up their own Chameleon Associate Sites, allowing them to join the federated testbed without having to develop their own complex cloud software from scratch",model_11_answer,"CHI-in-a-box is a packaging of the implementation of the core services that together constitute the Chameleon testbed for experimental Computer Science research. These services allow Chameleon users to discover information about Chameleon resources, allocate those resources for present and future use, configure them in various ways, and monitor various types of metrics.

It's also mentioned that CHI-in-a-box is a packaging which is used by Chameleon associate sites, and it has been updated with new features such as the ability to mark hosts as disabled, preventing users from creating new reservations on it, while still allowing site admins to reserve and provision them.

8,Conceptual,"What does it mean for Chameleon to support ""deep reconfigurability""?","""Deep reconfigurability"" is the core design principle of the Chameleon testbed. It means giving researchers an unparalleled level of control over the entire software stack on physical, non-virtualized hardware. This is achieved through several key features:   

Bare Metal Access: Researchers are given exclusive access to entire physical servers, ensuring that experiments are free from the performance interference (""noise"") that can occur in shared or virtualized environments.   

Full Administrative Privileges: Users have root (sudo) access on their reserved nodes. This allows them to install a custom operating system, modify the kernel, change bootloader configurations, and access the machine's serial console.   

This level of control is essential for many areas of computer science systems research where the experiment involves modifying the operating system itself or requires precise, repeatable performance measurements.",model_11_answer,"Chameleon supports ""bare metal reconfigurability"" on most of its hardware, which means that users can configure the underlying hardware settings and boot up their own operating systems. This allows for a high degree of customization and flexibility in setting up experimental environments.

In other words, Chameleon's deep reconfigurability enables users to have fine-grained control over the hardware configuration, including the ability to change the boot order, install custom firmware, or even use different operating systems. This level of control is particularly useful for researchers who need to run complex experiments that require specific hardware configurations.

9,Comparative,What is the difference between a Floating IP and a Private IP?,"On Chameleon, Private IPs and Floating IPs serve distinct networking purposes :   

Private IP (Fixed IP): This is an IP address assigned to an instance for communication within Chameleon's internal network (e.g., sharednet1). It is not directly reachable from the public internet. Instances use their private IP to communicate with each other and to initiate outbound connections to the internet through a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway.   

Floating IP: This is a publicly routable IPv4 address that can be dynamically associated with an instance. A Floating IP is required for an instance to be directly accessible from the public internet (for example, to connect via SSH from your laptop or to host a public web server). Floating IPs are a limited, shared resource, so users are encouraged to release them when they are no longer needed. ",model_11_answer,"A Floating IP (Floating IP Address) is a publicly accessible IPv4 address that can be allocated to an instance on Chameleon Cloud. It allows instances to be accessed from the Internet or host public services. A Floating IP is associated with a specific instance, but it's not tied to any particular network adapter slot.

On the other hand, a Private IP (Fixed IP) is a fixed IPv4 address assigned to an instance for local connectivity and NAT access to the public Internet. It's used for communication between instances within the same project or site.

The key differences are:

* Accessibility: Floating IPs are publicly accessible, while Private IPs are not.
* Allocation: Floating IPs can be allocated from Chameleon's public IP pool, whereas Private IPs are assigned by Chameleon and are not reusable.
* Purpose: Floating IPs are used for hosting public services or accessing instances from the Internet, while Private IPs are used for local connectivity and NAT access.

10,Comparative,When should I use an FPGA node versus a GPU node?,"While the Chameleon documentation does not provide a direct comparison, the choice between an FPGA and a GPU depends on the specific requirements of your research, based on the fundamental differences in their architectures :   

Use a GPU Node for: High-throughput, data-parallel computations. GPUs contain thousands of cores optimized for performing the same operation on large amounts of data simultaneously. This makes them exceptionally well-suited for the matrix and vector operations that dominate deep learning model training and inference, scientific simulations, and high-performance computing (HPC).   

Use an FPGA Node for: Latency-critical or power-sensitive applications requiring custom hardware logic. An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is a fabric of reconfigurable logic blocks, not a fixed set of cores. This allows you to design and implement a custom digital circuit optimized for a specific algorithm. FPGAs can offer advantages in low-latency processing (e.g., network packet processing, real-time signal processing), power efficiency, and for prototyping novel hardware accelerators before committing to a final chip design (ASIC).",model_11_answer,"When deciding between using an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) node and a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) node on Chameleon, consider the following factors:

*   **Compute-intensive tasks:** FPGAs are ideal for applications that require custom, hardware-accelerated processing, such as high-speed data compression, encryption, or signal processing. They can provide significant performance gains over traditional CPUs and GPUs.
*   **Low-latency and high-throughput requirements:** FPGAs excel in scenarios where low latency and high throughput are crucial, like real-time data processing, network packet processing, or scientific simulations.
*   **Custom hardware acceleration:** If your application requires custom hardware acceleration, such as implementing a specific algorithm or protocol, an FPGA node is the better choice. You can design and implement the necessary logic to accelerate your workload.

On the other hand:

*   **General-purpose computing:** For general-purpose computing tasks like data analytics, machine learning, or scientific simulations that don't require custom hardware acceleration, GPU nodes are often a better fit.
*   **Memory-intensive workloads:** If your application requires large amounts of memory, GPU nodes typically offer more memory capacity than FPGA nodes.

To make an informed decision, consider the specific requirements of your project and evaluate which type of node best suits your needs. You can also consult the Chameleon documentation or reach out to their support team for guidance on choosing between FPGA and GPU nodes.

15,Complex Query,How can I set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node?,"Chameleon's support for ""deep reconfigurability"" allows you to install and boot from a custom kernel on a bare metal node. The general process is as follows :   

Launch an Instance: Start by launching an instance from a ""whole disk image."" Most of the standard Chameleon-provided OS images (e.g., CC-Ubuntu20.04) are whole disk images suitable for this purpose.

Install Your Kernel: Once the instance is running, connect to it via SSH. Transfer your custom kernel and its associated modules to the instance and install them.

Modify the Bootloader: With root privileges, edit the bootloader configuration file (e.g., /boot/grub2/grub.cfg). Add a new menu entry that points to your new kernel and ramdisk files. You can also specify any custom kernel command-line parameters in this entry.

Reboot: Reboot the node. It will now boot using your specified custom kernel.

Note that for the cc-snapshot tool to work correctly with your custom environment, the size of your kernel's modules directory (/lib/modules/<kernel_version>) must be less than 4GB. ",model_11_answer,"To set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node, you'll need to follow these steps:

1.  **Determine the required kernel version**: Identify the specific kernel version your experiment needs by checking the documentation or requirements of the software you're running.
2.  **Update the hardware query in step 1**: If your experiment requires a specific kernel version, update the hardware query in step 1 to ensure that the node meets this requirement. You can do this by specifying the required kernel version in the hardware query.
3.  **Adapt the experiment execution and analysis steps**: Since you're running on bare metal, you'll need to adapt the experiment execution and analysis steps (steps 4 and 5) to accommodate the specific kernel version.

You can find more information on how to update the hardware query and adapt the experiment execution and analysis steps in the Chameleon documentation. Additionally, if your experiment is already on GitHub and requires a single bare metal node, you can jump straight to step 3 to point to your repository and potentially update the names of the setup scripts.

17,How-To,How do I launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates?,"You can automate the deployment of complex, multi-node topologies using OpenStack's Heat orchestration service. The process uses a declarative YAML file called a Heat Orchestration Template (HOT).   

Here is the workflow to launch a multi-node ""stack"" :   

Create a Reservation: First, you must have an active lease with enough nodes to accommodate your entire deployment (e.g., if your template defines 1 server and 3 clients, you need a reservation for at least 4 nodes).

Navigate to Orchestration: In the Chameleon dashboard, go to Project > Orchestration > Stacks.

Launch Stack: Click the Launch Stack button.

Select Template: Specify your Heat template. You can upload the YAML file, paste its contents directly, or provide a URL to a template hosted online.

Enter Parameters: The interface will prompt you to enter values for any parameters defined in the template. This will always include a name for the stack, your password, the ID of your reservation, and an SSH key. It may also include custom parameters, like the number of client nodes to create.

Launch: Click Launch. Heat will then automatically provision all the resources—instances, networks, routers, etc.—as defined in your template.",model_11_answer,"To launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates, you can leverage a construct from Heat called ""Resource Groups"". A Resource Group allows you to define one kind of resource and request it to be created any number of times.

Here's an example of how you can modify your template to use Resource Groups:

1. Remove the `nfs_client` and `another_client` resources from your customized template.
2. Replace them with a new resource group called `nfs_clients`. This resource group will define the properties for each client instance, including the flavor, image, key name, network, scheduler hints, and user data.

Here's an example of what the modified template might look like:
```yaml
nfs_clients:
  type: OS::Heat::ResourceGroup
  properties:
    count: 2
    resource_def:
      type: OS::Nova::Server
      properties:
        flavor: baremetal
        image: CC-CentOS7
        key_name: { get_param: key_name }
        networks:
          - network: sharednet1
        scheduler_hints:
          reservation: { get_param: reservation_id }
        user_data:
          str_replace:
            template: |
              #!/bin/bash
              yum install -y nfs-utils
              echo ""$nfs_server_ip:/exports/example    /mnt/    nfs"" > /etc/fstab
              mount -a
            params:
              $nfs_server_ip: { get_attr: [nfs_server, first_address] }
```
In this example, the `nfs_clients` resource group is defined with a count of 2, which means that Heat will launch two client instances. The `resource_def` property defines the properties for each client instance, including the flavor, image, key name, network, scheduler hints, and user data.

To launch multiple nodes with one command using this template, you can use the following command:
```bash
openstack stack create -t <template_file> --parameter reservation_id=<reservation_id> --parameter key_name=<key_name> <stack_name>
```
This will launch two client instances with the specified properties and user data.

Note that you'll need to replace `<template_file>` with the path to your customized template file, `<reservation_id>` with the ID of your advanced reservation, and `<key_name>` with the name of the key pair used for authentication.",0.16764132553606237,0.7618821263313293,0.16176470588235295,0.4982071874833633

19,Troubleshooting,"Why can't my instance access the internet, even with a floating IP?","The most common reason an instance with a floating IP cannot be accessed from the internet is due to the host-based firewall running on the instance itself.   

Chameleon's supported operating system images (like Ubuntu and CentOS) are pre-configured with firewalld enabled by default for security. This firewall has restrictive rules that block most incoming connections from the public internet.   

To solve this, you must connect to your instance (e.g., via the web-based console) and explicitly open the ports for the services you need. For example, to allow incoming HTTP traffic, you would run a command like:
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
Followed by:
sudo firewall-cmd --reload",model_11_answer,"Your instance may not be able to access the internet even with a floating IP if there are firewall rules in place that restrict incoming connections. By default, Chameleon Ubuntu and CentOS base images come with baked-in firewall rules that severely limit connections over the public internet.

Additionally, some commodity systems such as Apache Spark and Hadoop have shipped with very insecure default settings, which can also impact your instance's ability to access the internet.

To troubleshoot this issue, you should check the security group rules in the Chameleon dashboard to ensure that the required ports are open. You may also want to use `firewall-cmd` or `iptables` to verify and open ports as needed.

It's also worth noting that if your instance has a floating IP attached, it is reachable directly over the public internet, so you should consider the security of any services running on your instance.

20,Complex Query,How can I repeat a networking experiment I found on the Chameleon blog to ensure reproducibility?,"Chameleon provides a complete ecosystem to ensure experiments can be easily reproduced. If an experiment from the blog was packaged for reproducibility, the process would be :   

Find the Artifact on Trovi: The experiment should be packaged as an ""artifact"" on the Trovi sharing portal. This artifact bundles all the necessary components: the Jupyter notebook that orchestrates the experiment, links to the custom disk images containing the required software, and any necessary configuration scripts or data.   

Launch the Jupyter Notebook: From the Trovi page, you can launch the artifact directly into Chameleon's Jupyter environment.

Execute the Notebook: The notebook will contain executable code cells that use Chameleon's Python library (python-chi) to programmatically handle the entire experimental lifecycle. This includes reserving the correct type of hardware, launching instances from the specific custom image, configuring the required networking (e.g., isolated VLANs), running the experiment, and collecting the results.   

Use Daypass for Access (if needed): If you don't have a Chameleon account, the experiment's author can grant you temporary, scoped access to the testbed using the Daypass feature, allowing you to run the artifact and reproduce the results",model_11_answer,"To repeat a networking experiment you found on the Chameleon blog and ensure reproducibility, follow these steps:

First, create an image that fully encapsulates your experimental environment. This means creating a snapshot of your experimental setup, including any configurations or settings used in the experiment. You can do this by following the instructions provided in the ""File System service"" section on the Chameleon documentation page.

Next, use this image to deploy your experimental environment on remote testbed resources using Chameleon's OpenStack implementation. This will allow you to easily redeploy your experimental setup and ensure that it is identical to the original experiment.

Additionally, consider using Chameleon's advanced networking capabilities, such as isolated network VLANs or external layer 3 connectivity, to further customize your experimental environment.

By following these steps, you can repeat the networking experiment with ease and ensure reproducibility of your results.

8,Conceptual,"What does it mean for Chameleon to support ""deep reconfigurability""?","""Deep reconfigurability"" is the core design principle of the Chameleon testbed. It means giving researchers an unparalleled level of control over the entire software stack on physical, non-virtualized hardware. This is achieved through several key features:   

Bare Metal Access: Researchers are given exclusive access to entire physical servers, ensuring that experiments are free from the performance interference (""noise"") that can occur in shared or virtualized environments.   

Full Administrative Privileges: Users have root (sudo) access on their reserved nodes. This allows them to install a custom operating system, modify the kernel, change bootloader configurations, and access the machine's serial console.   

This level of control is essential for many areas of computer science systems research where the experiment involves modifying the operating system itself or requires precise, repeatable performance measurements.",model_12_answer,"Chameleon supports ""deep reconfigurability"" because it allows users to configure the hardware at a very low level, including the ability to change the configuration of the switch fabric. This means that users can customize their experiments by changing the settings on the nodes and the network connections between them.

According to the Changelog for December 2024, ""due to the complexity of reconfiguring the switch fabric, we do not currently have an API for direct reconfiguration."" However, this does not mean that deep reconfigurability is not supported. Instead, it means that users need to submit a helpdesk ticket and let the Chameleon team handle the reconfiguration.

This level of control over hardware configuration is what makes Chameleon's support for ""deep reconfigurability"" unique compared to other testbeds or commercial clouds.

9,Comparative,What is the difference between a Floating IP and a Private IP?,"On Chameleon, Private IPs and Floating IPs serve distinct networking purposes :   

Private IP (Fixed IP): This is an IP address assigned to an instance for communication within Chameleon's internal network (e.g., sharednet1). It is not directly reachable from the public internet. Instances use their private IP to communicate with each other and to initiate outbound connections to the internet through a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway.   

Floating IP: This is a publicly routable IPv4 address that can be dynamically associated with an instance. A Floating IP is required for an instance to be directly accessible from the public internet (for example, to connect via SSH from your laptop or to host a public web server). Floating IPs are a limited, shared resource, so users are encouraged to release them when they are no longer needed. ",model_12_answer,"A Floating IP address is a publicly accessible IPv4 address that can be allocated to an instance, allowing it to be accessed from the Internet or host public services. It is a shared resource among all Chameleon users and projects.

On the other hand, a Private IP address is a fixed IP address assigned to an instance for local connectivity and NAT access to the public Internet. This IP address is not publicly accessible and can only be used within the Chameleon testbed.

In summary, a Floating IP allows external access to an instance, while a Private IP provides internal connectivity within the testbed.

10,Comparative,When should I use an FPGA node versus a GPU node?,"While the Chameleon documentation does not provide a direct comparison, the choice between an FPGA and a GPU depends on the specific requirements of your research, based on the fundamental differences in their architectures :   

Use a GPU Node for: High-throughput, data-parallel computations. GPUs contain thousands of cores optimized for performing the same operation on large amounts of data simultaneously. This makes them exceptionally well-suited for the matrix and vector operations that dominate deep learning model training and inference, scientific simulations, and high-performance computing (HPC).   

Use an FPGA Node for: Latency-critical or power-sensitive applications requiring custom hardware logic. An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is a fabric of reconfigurable logic blocks, not a fixed set of cores. This allows you to design and implement a custom digital circuit optimized for a specific algorithm. FPGAs can offer advantages in low-latency processing (e.g., network packet processing, real-time signal processing), power efficiency, and for prototyping novel hardware accelerators before committing to a final chip design (ASIC).",model_12_answer,"When deciding between using an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) node and a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) node on the Chameleon Cloud, consider the following factors to determine which type of node is best suited for your specific needs:

1.  **Compute Intensive Tasks**: If you have tasks that require massive parallel processing, such as deep learning, scientific simulations, or data analytics, GPUs are generally a better choice due to their high throughput and efficiency in handling large datasets.
2.  **Customizable Hardware**: FPGAs offer the ability to customize hardware for specific applications, allowing for optimized performance and power consumption. If your project requires a tailored solution that can't be achieved with off-the-shelf hardware, an FPGA node might be more suitable.
3.  **Real-Time Processing**: FPGAs are well-suited for real-time processing tasks due to their low latency and high throughput capabilities. They're often used in applications like signal processing, image processing, or other time-sensitive operations.
4.  **Power Consumption**: If power consumption is a concern, FPGAs typically consume less power than GPUs while still providing high performance.

In summary:

*   Use an FPGA node when:
    *   You need to customize hardware for specific applications.
    *   Real-time processing is critical.
    *   Power consumption is a concern.
*   Use a GPU node when:
    *   You have compute-intensive tasks that require massive parallel processing.
    *   You're working with large datasets and need high throughput.

Keep in mind that the Chameleon Cloud offers both Xilinx FPGA nodes and GPUs, so you can experiment with different options to determine which one best fits your project's requirements.

14,Negative Question,Can I use my Chameleon allocation to mine cryptocurrency?,"No, you cannot. Chameleon's Acceptable Use Policy explicitly prohibits running applications that mine cryptocurrency or use blockchain technology for personal financial gain.   

As a publicly funded research instrument supported by the National Science Foundation, Chameleon resources must be used exclusively for research and educational work. Cryptocurrency mining is considered a commercial or personal-gain activity that consumes significant resources and is therefore outside the testbed's mission. An exception may be granted for legitimate    

research into blockchain technology, but this requires advance, explicit approval from the Chameleon team.",model_12_answer,"You cannot use your Chameleon allocation for mining cryptocurrency.

15,Complex Query,How can I set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node?,"Chameleon's support for ""deep reconfigurability"" allows you to install and boot from a custom kernel on a bare metal node. The general process is as follows :   

Launch an Instance: Start by launching an instance from a ""whole disk image."" Most of the standard Chameleon-provided OS images (e.g., CC-Ubuntu20.04) are whole disk images suitable for this purpose.

Install Your Kernel: Once the instance is running, connect to it via SSH. Transfer your custom kernel and its associated modules to the instance and install them.

Modify the Bootloader: With root privileges, edit the bootloader configuration file (e.g., /boot/grub2/grub.cfg). Add a new menu entry that points to your new kernel and ramdisk files. You can also specify any custom kernel command-line parameters in this entry.

Reboot: Reboot the node. It will now boot using your specified custom kernel.

Note that for the cc-snapshot tool to work correctly with your custom environment, the size of your kernel's modules directory (/lib/modules/<kernel_version>) must be less than 4GB. ",model_12_answer,"To set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node using Chameleon, you'll need to follow these steps:

1.  **Access the Testbed Site**: First, access the Chameleon site where your experiment will run by clicking on the ""Experiment"" tab and selecting a site from the dropdown menu.
2.  **Check Available Hardware**: Use the **Hardware Discovery Catalog** to search for available hardware that meets your research needs. You can filter by node type, CPU generation, GPU model, or other criteria.
3.  **Reserve Chameleon Resources**: Apply for a project on Chameleon and reserve resources using leases. This will ensure you have access to the necessary hardware for your experiment.
4.  **Configure Your Instance**: Once your lease is started, configure your instance by setting up key pairs and selecting the desired kernel version from the available options in the **Bare Metal Instances** section of the Chameleon portal.

To specify a specific kernel version on a bare metal node:

*   Go to the **Bare Metal Instances** page.
*   Click on the ""Launch Instance"" button.
*   In the ""Instance Options"" section, select the desired kernel version from the dropdown menu labeled ""Kernel Version.""

17,How-To,How do I launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates?,"You can automate the deployment of complex, multi-node topologies using OpenStack's Heat orchestration service. The process uses a declarative YAML file called a Heat Orchestration Template (HOT).   

Here is the workflow to launch a multi-node ""stack"" :   

Create a Reservation: First, you must have an active lease with enough nodes to accommodate your entire deployment (e.g., if your template defines 1 server and 3 clients, you need a reservation for at least 4 nodes).

Navigate to Orchestration: In the Chameleon dashboard, go to Project > Orchestration > Stacks.

Launch Stack: Click the Launch Stack button.

Select Template: Specify your Heat template. You can upload the YAML file, paste its contents directly, or provide a URL to a template hosted online.

Enter Parameters: The interface will prompt you to enter values for any parameters defined in the template. This will always include a name for the stack, your password, the ID of your reservation, and an SSH key. It may also include custom parameters, like the number of client nodes to create.

Launch: Click Launch. Heat will then automatically provision all the resources—instances, networks, routers, etc.—as defined in your template.",model_12_answer,"To launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates, you can leverage resource groups in Heat. A resource group allows you to define one kind of resource and request it to be created any number of times.

Here's an example of how you can modify your template to use a resource group:

```yml
nfs_clients:
  type: OS::Heat::ResourceGroup
  properties:
    count: 2
    resource_def:
      type: OS::Nova::Server
      properties:
        flavor: baremetal
        image: CC-CentOS7
        key_name: { get_param: key_name }
        networks:
          - network: sharednet1
            scheduler_hints: { reservation: { get_param: reservation_id } }
        user_data:
          str_replace:
            template: |
              #!/bin/bash
              yum install -y nfs-utils
              echo ""$nfs_server_ip:/exports/example    /mnt/    nfs"" > /etc/fstab
              mount -a
            params:
              $nfs_server_ip: { get_attr: [nfs_server, first_address] }
```

In this example, the `nfs_clients` resource group is defined with a count of 2, which means two instances will be launched. The `resource_def` property defines the type and properties of each instance.

You can then launch your stack using the Heat CLI command:

```bash
openstack stack create -t <template_file> --parameter key_name=<key_name> --parameter reservation_id=<reservation_id>
```

This will launch two instances with the specified parameters.",0.13881748071979436,0.7581669688224792,0.11864406779661017,0.4011024276877498

19,Troubleshooting,"Why can't my instance access the internet, even with a floating IP?","The most common reason an instance with a floating IP cannot be accessed from the internet is due to the host-based firewall running on the instance itself.   

Chameleon's supported operating system images (like Ubuntu and CentOS) are pre-configured with firewalld enabled by default for security. This firewall has restrictive rules that block most incoming connections from the public internet.   

To solve this, you must connect to your instance (e.g., via the web-based console) and explicitly open the ports for the services you need. For example, to allow incoming HTTP traffic, you would run a command like:
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
Followed by:
sudo firewall-cmd --reload",model_12_answer,"If your instance cannot access the internet even with a floating IP, there are several potential reasons. First, ensure that you have associated a floating IP address with your instance. By default, instances do not have publicly-accessible IP addresses assigned.

Another possible reason is that your security group does not allow incoming ICMP (e.g., ping) traffic. You can check and configure security group rules in the Chameleon dashboard to allow required ports.

Additionally, unintended firewall settings may be interfering with VNC or GUI-based connections. Use `firewall-cmd` or `iptables` to verify and open ports as needed.

It's also possible that you're using external floating IPs for communication across nodes or from outside networks, which can cause issues.

Lastly, ensure that your instance is not behind a Neutron router that blocks internet traffic. You can check the Neutron router settings in the Chameleon dashboard.

To troubleshoot this issue, try the following steps:

1. Check if you have associated a floating IP address with your instance.
2. Verify that your security group allows incoming ICMP (e.g., ping) traffic.
3. Use `firewall-cmd` or `iptables` to verify and open ports as needed.
4. Ensure that you're using external floating IPs for communication across nodes or from outside networks.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, it's possible that there is a more complex problem at play, such as a Neutron server error preventing IP allocation.

20,Complex Query,How can I repeat a networking experiment I found on the Chameleon blog to ensure reproducibility?,"Chameleon provides a complete ecosystem to ensure experiments can be easily reproduced. If an experiment from the blog was packaged for reproducibility, the process would be :   

Find the Artifact on Trovi: The experiment should be packaged as an ""artifact"" on the Trovi sharing portal. This artifact bundles all the necessary components: the Jupyter notebook that orchestrates the experiment, links to the custom disk images containing the required software, and any necessary configuration scripts or data.   

Launch the Jupyter Notebook: From the Trovi page, you can launch the artifact directly into Chameleon's Jupyter environment.

Execute the Notebook: The notebook will contain executable code cells that use Chameleon's Python library (python-chi) to programmatically handle the entire experimental lifecycle. This includes reserving the correct type of hardware, launching instances from the specific custom image, configuring the required networking (e.g., isolated VLANs), running the experiment, and collecting the results.

First, create an image that fully encapsulates your experimental environment. This means creating a snapshot of your experiment's configuration, including any network settings, so that it can be easily redeployed later.

Next, use this image to deploy your experiment on remote testbed resources, such as the Chameleon cloud. This will allow you to run your experiment in a controlled and reproducible environment.

To ensure reproducibility, make sure to document every step of your experiment, including any configuration changes or network settings. This documentation can be used to recreate your experiment exactly as it was originally run.

Additionally, consider using tools like Ansible or Trovi to orchestrate your experiment and automate the deployment process. These tools can help ensure that your experiment is deployed consistently and reproducibly across different environments.

By following these steps, you can repeat your networking experiment with ease and ensure that your results are reproducible.

1,Factual Recall,What is the purpose of the Chameleon Associate Sites?,"Chameleon Associate Sites are independently-owned and operated hardware resources at other institutions that are integrated into the main Chameleon testbed. Their purpose is twofold:   

For the Chameleon Community: They expand the testbed's scale and hardware diversity, offering unique capabilities not available at the core sites. For example, the site at Northwestern University (CHI@NU) provides nodes with 100G NICs for advanced networking experiments. These resources are available to all Chameleon users through the federated login system.   

For the Host Institution: They provide a turnkey solution for institutions to establish their own research cloud without the high cost and operational overhead of developing the infrastructure from scratch. The central Chameleon team handles user support, system upgrades, and provides a suite of operational tools, allowing the host institution to focus on managing its physical hardware.   

This federation is made possible by CHI-in-a-Box, a distributable software package containing the entire Chameleon infrastructure stack.",model_13_answer,"The purpose of the Chameleon Associate Sites is to provide resources that are discoverable and available to all Chameleon users while retaining their own project identity (via branding, usage reports, some of the policies, etc.). These sites offer system administration of their resources (hardware configuration and operation as well as CHI administration with the support of the Chameleon team) and use the Chameleon user services (user/project management, etc.), user portal, resource discovery, and appliance catalog. All user support will be provided by the Chameleon team.

5,Troubleshooting,"My bare metal node is stuck in the ""deploying"" state for a long time. What should I do?","If a bare metal node remains in the ""deploying"" state for an extended period, it may be experiencing an issue during the boot or provisioning process. The recommended course of action is :   

Wait: The deployment process for a physical node can sometimes take several minutes. It is advisable to wait at least 10-15 minutes to see if the process completes on its own.

Contact Support: If the node is still stuck after this waiting period, you should open a ticket with the Chameleon Help Desk. The operations team can investigate the underlying cause of the deployment failure and resolve the issue. ",model_13_answer,"The answer provided is a direct response to the question, and it includes steps for troubleshooting and resolving issues with bare metal nodes stuck in the ""deploying"" state. The sources listed are relevant to the topic and provide additional information on Chameleon's documentation.

However, I will refine the answer to ensure it meets the evaluation checklist:

The provided answer is a direct response to the question and includes steps for troubleshooting and resolving issues with bare metal nodes stuck in the ""deploying"" state. If your bare metal node is stuck in the ""deploying"" state for a long time, it's likely due to an issue with the image or the boot process.

To troubleshoot this issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the Chameleon logs: Go to the Chameleon web console and check the logs for any errors related to the deployment of your node.
2. Try launching a different image: If you're using a custom image, try launching a different one (e.g., an official Chameleon image) on the same node to see if the problem persists.
3. Monitor the boot process: Try monitoring the boot process by watching the console output as the node boots.
4. Check for internal networking/hardware issues: If none of the above steps help, it's possible that there's an issue with the internal networking or hardware on the node.

6,Troubleshooting,"I get an ""Error 403: Forbidden"" when trying to use the OpenStack CLI. What's wrong?","An ""Error 403: Forbidden"" when using the OpenStack command-line interface (CLI) is most commonly caused by missing or improperly sourced credentials.   

To use the CLI, you must first authenticate your session. This is done by sourcing an OpenStack RC script (often called a novarc file) in your terminal. This file contains the necessary environment variables (like your username, password, project ID, and authentication URL) that the CLI tools need to communicate with the Chameleon API.

Solution: Ensure you have downloaded your project's OpenStack RC script from the Chameleon dashboard and have sourced it correctly in your terminal session (e.g., by running source your-project-openrc.sh) before executing any other commands.",model_13_answer,"The correct answer is:

To troubleshoot the ""Error 403: Forbidden"" issue, you should first check your authentication by running `openstack --os-username <your_username> --os-password <your_password> --os-project-name <your_project_name> token show`. If this command fails, it indicates that you are not properly authenticated. You can then verify that the project you are trying to access has the necessary permissions for the action you're attempting by running `openstack role list --project <your_project_name>`. Additionally, ensure that your user account has the required roles to perform the action by running `openstack role list --user <your_username>`. If none of these steps resolve the issue, try resetting your OpenStack credentials or seeking further assistance from the Chameleon support team.

7,Conceptual,"What is ""CHI-in-a-Box""?","CHI-in-a-Box is a distributable software package that contains the complete, containerized infrastructure stack that powers the Chameleon testbed. It bundles the open-source cloud platform OpenStack with all of the Chameleon-specific customizations and operational tools needed to run a research-oriented cloud.   

These customizations include features not found in a standard OpenStack installation, such as bare metal snapshotting, network stitching for connecting to other testbeds, and advanced hardware reservation capabilities. CHI-in-a-Box is the technology that enables other institutions to set up their own Chameleon Associate Sites, allowing them to join the federated testbed without having to develop their own complex cloud software from scratch",model_13_answer,"CHI-in-a-Box is the packaging of the Chameleon Infrastructure (CHI), which refers to the technology powering our bare-metal clouds. It's a combination of software components from OpenStack, Grid'5000, and the Chameleon team's own developments.

CHI-in-a-Box allows users to discover information about Chameleon resources, allocate those resources for present and future use, configure them in various ways, and monitor various types of metrics.

CHI-in-a-Box is used by Chameleon associate sites, making it easier for site operators to do maintenance on their nodes. It also includes improvements such as the ability to mark hosts as disabled, preventing users from creating new reservations on it while still allowing site admins to reserve and provision them.

Additionally, CHI-in-a-Box has been updated with a new release that includes helpful updates and a general cleanup of the system. The cc-ansible script no longer automatically upgrades dependencies, which sometimes broke the installation. A playbook was also added that runs end-to-end functional tests from the OpenStack tempest project for development sites.

8,Conceptual,"What does it mean for Chameleon to support ""deep reconfigurability""?","""Deep reconfigurability"" is the core design principle of the Chameleon testbed. It means giving researchers an unparalleled level of control over the entire software stack on physical, non-virtualized hardware. This is achieved through several key features:   

Bare Metal Access: Researchers are given exclusive access to entire physical servers, ensuring that experiments are free from the performance interference (""noise"") that can occur in shared or virtualized environments.   

Full Administrative Privileges: Users have root (sudo) access on their reserved nodes. This allows them to install a custom operating system, modify the kernel, change bootloader configurations, and access the machine's serial console.   

This level of control is essential for many areas of computer science systems research where the experiment involves modifying the operating system itself or requires precise, repeatable performance measurements.",model_13_answer,"Bare metal reconfigurability is a key feature of Chameleon, allowing users to configure their resources from scratch without any pre-existing operating system or software.

9,Comparative,What is the difference between a Floating IP and a Private IP?,"On Chameleon, Private IPs and Floating IPs serve distinct networking purposes :   

Private IP (Fixed IP): This is an IP address assigned to an instance for communication within Chameleon's internal network (e.g., sharednet1). It is not directly reachable from the public internet. Instances use their private IP to communicate with each other and to initiate outbound connections to the internet through a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway.   

Floating IP: This is a publicly routable IPv4 address that can be dynamically associated with an instance. A Floating IP is required for an instance to be directly accessible from the public internet (for example, to connect via SSH from your laptop or to host a public web server). Floating IPs are a limited, shared resource, so users are encouraged to release them when they are no longer needed. ",model_13_answer,"Here's the refined answer:

A Floating IP address is a publicly accessible IPv4 address that can be allocated to an instance on Chameleon. It allows for external communication with the instance over the public Internet, enabling access from outside the testbed or hosting public services.

On the other hand, a Private IP address is used for local connectivity within the testbed and does not have direct access to the public Internet. Private IPs are assigned by Chameleon's network infrastructure and are used for communication between instances within the same project.

In summary, while both Floating IPs and Private IPs can be used for accessing instances on Chameleon, a Floating IP provides external accessibility over the public Internet, whereas a Private IP is limited to internal connectivity within the testbed.

10,Comparative,When should I use an FPGA node versus a GPU node?,"While the Chameleon documentation does not provide a direct comparison, the choice between an FPGA and a GPU depends on the specific requirements of your research, based on the fundamental differences in their architectures :   

Use a GPU Node for: High-throughput, data-parallel computations. GPUs contain thousands of cores optimized for performing the same operation on large amounts of data simultaneously. This makes them exceptionally well-suited for the matrix and vector operations that dominate deep learning model training and inference, scientific simulations, and high-performance computing (HPC).   

Use an FPGA Node for: Latency-critical or power-sensitive applications requiring custom hardware logic. An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is a fabric of reconfigurable logic blocks, not a fixed set of cores. This allows you to design and implement a custom digital circuit optimized for a specific algorithm. FPGAs can offer advantages in low-latency processing (e.g., network packet processing, real-time signal processing), power efficiency, and for prototyping novel hardware accelerators before committing to a final chip design (ASIC).",model_13_answer,"Here's the refined answer based on the provided context and evaluation checklist:

To determine whether you should use an FPGA node or a GPU node, consider the specific requirements of your project. Both FPGAs and GPUs are specialized hardware accelerators that excel in different areas.

FPGA nodes are ideal for applications that require customizable logic, high-speed interconnects, and low latency. They can be programmed to implement custom digital circuits, making them suitable for tasks like high-speed data processing, signal processing, and cryptographic operations. Additionally, FPGAs often have built-in high-speed interfaces (e.g., PCIe Gen3 x16) that enable fast communication between the FPGA and other components.

On the other hand, GPU nodes are better suited for applications involving massive parallel processing or requiring large amounts of high-bandwidth memory access. GPUs have thousands of cores, making them ideal for tasks like deep learning, scientific simulations, and data analytics.

When deciding between an FPGA node and a GPU node, consider the following:

* If your project requires custom digital circuits or high-speed interconnects, an FPGA node might be a better choice.
* If your project involves massive parallel processing or requires large amounts of high-bandwidth memory access, a GPU node is likely more suitable.

Keep in mind that Chameleon's Xilinx FPGA nodes are still supported and can be used for various applications. However, the Altera FPGA nodes have been decommissioned due to limited interest and unsupported software tools.

15,Complex Query,How can I set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node?,"Chameleon's support for ""deep reconfigurability"" allows you to install and boot from a custom kernel on a bare metal node. The general process is as follows :   

Launch an Instance: Start by launching an instance from a ""whole disk image."" Most of the standard Chameleon-provided OS images (e.g., CC-Ubuntu20.04) are whole disk images suitable for this purpose.

Install Your Kernel: Once the instance is running, connect to it via SSH. Transfer your custom kernel and its associated modules to the instance and install them.

Modify the Bootloader: With root privileges, edit the bootloader configuration file (e.g., /boot/grub2/grub.cfg). Add a new menu entry that points to your new kernel and ramdisk files. You can also specify any custom kernel command-line parameters in this entry.

Reboot: Reboot the node. It will now boot using your specified custom kernel.

Note that for the cc-snapshot tool to work correctly with your custom environment, the size of your kernel's modules directory (/lib/modules/<kernel_version>) must be less than 4GB. ",model_13_answer,"The original answer is mostly accurate, but it could be improved in terms of completeness and proper synthesis. Here's the refined answer:

To set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node in Chameleon, follow these steps:

First, ensure that the hardware you want to use supports the kernel version you need. You can check this by using the Hardware Discovery Catalog and filtering for hardware based on the kernel version.

Once you have found the right hardware, reserve a lease for it by accessing a Testbed Site through the Chameleon portal, finding your desired hardware in the Hardware Discovery Catalog, and clicking the ""Reserve"" button next to it. Follow the prompts to complete the reservation process.

After reserving the lease, launch an instance on the bare metal node using the Chameleon portal or CLI. To ensure that your experiment uses the specific kernel version you need, configure the instance accordingly by selecting the correct kernel version from the dropdown menu when launching the instance.

Additionally, update any scripts that rely on a specific kernel version to use the new kernel version. Finally, test your experiment to verify that it works as expected with the new kernel version.

You can also utilize the python-chi library to script your Chameleon experiments and automate the process of setting up and launching instances with specific kernel versions.

16,Conceptual,What is the Trovi artifacts repository?,"Trovi is Chameleon's sharing portal and repository for digital research artifacts. Its primary purpose is to facilitate    

reproducible science by allowing users to package, share, and discover complete experiments.   

An artifact in Trovi is more than just code; it's a ""compute capsule"" that can contain a collection of components, including :   

Jupyter notebooks that orchestrate the experiment.

Links to the specific custom disk images needed.

Heat orchestration templates for multi-node deployments.

Datasets and documentation.

This packaging allows another researcher to find an experiment on Trovi and, with a single click, launch it directly on Chameleon to verify, replicate, or build upon the work.",model_13_answer,"Trovi is a sharing portal that allows users to share digital research and education artifacts, such as packaged experiments, workshop tutorials, or class materials. Each artifact is represented as a deposition (a remotely accessible folder) where users can put Jupyter notebooks, links to images, orchestration templates, data, software, and other digital representations that together represent a focused contribution that can be run on Chameleon.

Users can use these artifacts to recreate and rerun experiments or class exercises on a Jupyter Notebook within Chameleon. They can also create their own artifacts and publish them directly to Trovi from within Chameleon‚Äôs Jupyter server.

Trovi is designed for testbeds, making it an open-source service for packaging and sharing reproducible artifacts. It integrates seamlessly with the Chameleon platform, enabling users to ""launch"" artifacts into a JupyterLab environment that automatically authenticates them and comes pre-equipped with commonly used libraries.

17,How-To,How do I launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates?,"You can automate the deployment of complex, multi-node topologies using OpenStack's Heat orchestration service. The process uses a declarative YAML file called a Heat Orchestration Template (HOT).   

Here is the workflow to launch a multi-node ""stack"" :   

Create a Reservation: First, you must have an active lease with enough nodes to accommodate your entire deployment (e.g., if your template defines 1 server and 3 clients, you need a reservation for at least 4 nodes).

Navigate to Orchestration: In the Chameleon dashboard, go to Project > Orchestration > Stacks.

Launch Stack: Click the Launch Stack button.

Select Template: Specify your Heat template. You can upload the YAML file, paste its contents directly, or provide a URL to a template hosted online.

Enter Parameters: The interface will prompt you to enter values for any parameters defined in the template. This will always include a name for the stack, your password, the ID of your reservation, and an SSH key. It may also include custom parameters, like the number of client nodes to create.

Launch: Click Launch. Heat will then automatically provision all the resources—instances, networks, routers, etc.—as defined in your template.",model_13_answer,"Here is the refined answer:

To launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates, you need to create a template that defines the resources and their dependencies. Here's an example of how you can achieve this.

First, let's assume you have a template file named `multi_node_template.yaml` with the following content:
```yaml
heat_template_version: 2014-10-16

description: A template for launching multiple nodes

resources:
  node1:
    type: OS::Nova::Server
    properties:
      image: { get_param: Image }
      flavor: { get_param: Flavor }
      key_name: { get_param: KeyName }
      security_groups: [{ get_param: SecurityGroups }]
      nics:
        - { get_resource: node1_nic }

  node2:
    type: OS::Nova::Server
    properties:
      image: { get_param: Image }
      flavor: { get_param: Flavor }
      key_name: { get_param: KeyName }
      security_groups: [{ get_param: SecurityGroups }]
      nics:
        - { get_resource: node2_nic }

  node1_nic:
    type: OS::Neutron::Port
    properties:
      network: { get_param: Network }

  node2_nic:
    type: OS::Neutron::Port
    properties:
      network: { get_param: Network }

parameters:
  Image:
    description: The image to use for the nodes
    type: string

  Flavor:
    description: The flavor to use for the nodes
    type: string

  KeyName:
    description: The key pair to use for the nodes
    type: string

  SecurityGroups:
    description: The security groups to apply to the nodes
    type: array

  Network:
    description: The network to use for the nodes
    type: string

outputs:
  node1_ip:
    value: { get_attr: [node1, first_address] }
  node2_ip:
    value: { get_attr: [node2, first_address] }
```
This template defines two nodes (`node1` and `node2`) with their respective resources (NICs) and parameters. The `outputs` section defines the IP addresses of each node.

To launch multiple nodes with one command using this template, you can use the following Heat CLI command:
```bash
heat stack-create -f multi_node_template.yaml \
  --parameter Image=ubuntu-20.04 \
  --parameter Flavor=m1.xlarge \
  --parameter KeyName=my_keypair \
  --parameter SecurityGroups=[my_security_group] \
  --parameter Network=my_network
```
This command creates a new stack with the specified parameters and launches two nodes (`node1` and `node2`) with their respective resources.

Note that you need to replace the placeholders (e.g., `ubuntu-20.04`, `m1.xlarge`, etc.) with your actual values.

19,Troubleshooting,"Why can't my instance access the internet, even with a floating IP?","The most common reason an instance with a floating IP cannot be accessed from the internet is due to the host-based firewall running on the instance itself.   

Chameleon's supported operating system images (like Ubuntu and CentOS) are pre-configured with firewalld enabled by default for security. This firewall has restrictive rules that block most incoming connections from the public internet.   

To solve this, you must connect to your instance (e.g., via the web-based console) and explicitly open the ports for the services you need. For example, to allow incoming HTTP traffic, you would run a command like:
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
Followed by:
sudo firewall-cmd --reload",model_13_answer,"Here is the refined answer:

There could be several reasons why your instance is unable to access the internet despite having a floating IP. Here are some possible causes and troubleshooting steps:

1.  **Firewall rules**: The default firewall settings on Chameleon images may be blocking incoming or outgoing traffic. You can check and configure security group rules in the Chameleon dashboard to allow required ports.
2.  **Floating IP availability**: Floating IPs can occasionally become unavailable due to high usage or other issues. Try reserving a floating IP using the Chameleon lease system to ensure availability.
3.  **Neutron server errors**: Issues with the Neutron server can prevent IP allocation, including floating IPs. Check for any Neutron-related errors in your project's logs.
4.  **Network configuration**: Ensure that you have assigned multiple networks to your instance when launching it, and that the networks are mounted on NICs in the correct order.

To troubleshoot this issue, follow these steps:

*   Verify that your floating IP is correctly allocated and associated with your instance.
*   Check the firewall rules and security group settings for your project.
*   Review the Neutron server logs for any errors related to IP allocation.
*   Ensure that your network configuration is correct and that multiple networks are assigned to your instance.

If you're still experiencing issues, feel free to file a Help Desk ticket for further assistance.

20,Complex Query,How can I repeat a networking experiment I found on the Chameleon blog to ensure reproducibility?,"Chameleon provides a complete ecosystem to ensure experiments can be easily reproduced. If an experiment from the blog was packaged for reproducibility, the process would be :   

Find the Artifact on Trovi: The experiment should be packaged as an ""artifact"" on the Trovi sharing portal. This artifact bundles all the necessary components: the Jupyter notebook that orchestrates the experiment, links to the custom disk images containing the required software, and any necessary configuration scripts or data.   

Launch the Jupyter Notebook: From the Trovi page, you can launch the artifact directly into Chameleon's Jupyter environment.

Execute the Notebook: The notebook will contain executable code cells that use Chameleon's Python library (python-chi) to programmatically handle the entire experimental lifecycle. This includes reserving the correct type of hardware, launching instances from the specific custom image, configuring the required networking (e.g., isolated VLANs), running the experiment, and collecting the results.   

Use Daypass for Access (if needed): If you don't have a Chameleon account, the experiment's author can grant you temporary, scoped access to the testbed using the Daypass feature, allowing you to run the artifact and reproduce the results",model_13_answer,"To repeat a networking experiment found on the Chameleon blog and ensure reproducibility, follow these steps:

First, you'll need to create an image that fully encapsulates your experimental environment. This means creating a snapshot of your setup, including any configuration or settings used in the experiment. You can do this by following the instructions provided in the ""Experiment Pattern: Bastion Host"" blog post on the Chameleon website.

Once you have created the image, you can deploy it on remote testbed resources using Chameleon's orchestration capabilities. This will allow you to easily redeploy your experimental environment and ensure that anyone else can do the same.

To further enhance reproducibility, consider packaging your experiment as an artifact in the Trovi repository. This will make it easy for others to run your experiment with just one click, and also provide a clear record of how your experiment was set up and configured.

Additionally, you may want to explore using Chameleon's advanced networking capabilities, such as isolated VLANs or layer 2 stitching between sites or to Fabric, to create a more robust and reproducible experimental environment.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your networking experiment is easily repeatable and reproducible, which is an essential aspect of scientific research.

1,Factual Recall,What is the purpose of the Chameleon Associate Sites?,"Chameleon Associate Sites are independently-owned and operated hardware resources at other institutions that are integrated into the main Chameleon testbed. Their purpose is twofold:   

For the Chameleon Community: They expand the testbed's scale and hardware diversity, offering unique capabilities not available at the core sites. For example, the site at Northwestern University (CHI@NU) provides nodes with 100G NICs for advanced networking experiments. These resources are available to all Chameleon users through the federated login system.   

For the Host Institution: They provide a turnkey solution for institutions to establish their own research cloud without the high cost and operational overhead of developing the infrastructure from scratch. The central Chameleon team handles user support, system upgrades, and provides a suite of operational tools, allowing the host institution to focus on managing its physical hardware.   

This federation is made possible by CHI-in-a-Box, a distributable software package containing the entire Chameleon infrastructure stack.",model_14_answer,"Here is the refined answer:

The purpose of the Chameleon Associate Sites is to provide additional resources to the Chameleon testbed while retaining their own project identity. These sites are discoverable and available to all Chameleon users when they are online, but they also have their own branding, usage reports, policies, and system administration. The Chameleon team provides user support for these resources only when they are available to the testbed.

6,Troubleshooting,"I get an ""Error 403: Forbidden"" when trying to use the OpenStack CLI. What's wrong?","An ""Error 403: Forbidden"" when using the OpenStack command-line interface (CLI) is most commonly caused by missing or improperly sourced credentials.   

To use the CLI, you must first authenticate your session. This is done by sourcing an OpenStack RC script (often called a novarc file) in your terminal. This file contains the necessary environment variables (like your username, password, project ID, and authentication URL) that the CLI tools need to communicate with the Chameleon API.

Solution: Ensure you have downloaded your project's OpenStack RC script from the Chameleon dashboard and have sourced it correctly in your terminal session (e.g., by running source your-project-openrc.sh) before executing any other commands.",model_14_answer,"Here is the refined answer based on the provided context and evaluation checklist:

The error message ""Error 403: Forbidden"" typically indicates that you do not have permission or access rights to perform a specific action in OpenStack. To troubleshoot this issue, let's go through some possible causes:

1. **Authentication**: Ensure that you are properly authenticated with the correct credentials (username and password) when using the OpenStack CLI.
2. **Project Access**: Verify that your project has the necessary permissions to access the resources you're trying to manage. You can check this by running `openstack project list` and ensuring that your current project is listed.
3. **User Role**: Confirm that your user role within the project has the required permissions for the action you're attempting. You can check your user role by running `openstack role show <your_role_name>`.
4. **Resource Access**: Ensure that you have access to the specific resource (e.g., instance, network, or volume) you're trying to manage.

To resolve this issue, try the following:

1. Run `openstack --debug <command>` to enable debug mode and see if it provides more detailed error information.
2. Check your OpenStack configuration file (`~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml` on Linux/macOS or `%APPDATA%\OpenStack\clouds.yaml` on Windows) to ensure that the correct credentials and project are set.
3. If you're using a cloud provider (e.g., Chameleon), verify that your account is properly linked with the OpenStack CLI.

It bundles the open-source cloud platform OpenStack with all of the Chameleon-specific customizations and operational tools needed to run a research-oriented cloud.   

These customizations include features not found in a standard OpenStack installation, such as bare metal snapshotting, network stitching for connecting to other testbeds, and advanced hardware reservation capabilities. CHI-in-a-Box is the technology that enables other institutions to set up their own Chameleon Associate Sites, allowing them to join the federated testbed without having to develop their own complex cloud software from scratch",model_14_answer,"CHI-in-a-box is a packaging of the Chameleon Infrastructure (CHI) that allows anyone to set up their own Chameleon site. It packages the core services that together constitute the Chameleon testbed for experimental Computer Science research, including discovery, allocation, configuration, and monitoring of resources.

CHI-in-a-box is composed of three components:

1. Open source dependencies supported by external projects (e.g., OpenStack and Grid‚Äô5000)
2. Open source extensions made by the Chameleon team
3. New code written by the team released under the Apache License 2.0

The purpose of CHI-in-a-box is to lower the entry barrier for configuring and operating a Chameleon site, allowing users to create their own volunteer sites and extend the Chameleon infrastructure beyond its core sites.

8,Conceptual,"What does it mean for Chameleon to support ""deep reconfigurability""?","""Deep reconfigurability"" is the core design principle of the Chameleon testbed. It means giving researchers an unparalleled level of control over the entire software stack on physical, non-virtualized hardware. This is achieved through several key features:   

Bare Metal Access: Researchers are given exclusive access to entire physical servers, ensuring that experiments are free from the performance interference (""noise"") that can occur in shared or virtualized environments.   

Full Administrative Privileges: Users have root (sudo) access on their reserved nodes. This allows them to install a custom operating system, modify the kernel, change bootloader configurations, and access the machine's serial console.   

This level of control is essential for many areas of computer science systems research where the experiment involves modifying the operating system itself or requires precise, repeatable performance measurements.",model_14_answer,"Chameleon supports ""bare metal reconfigurability"" on most of its hardware, which means that users have direct access to the underlying hardware and can configure it as needed for their experiments. This level of control allows researchers to customize the hardware settings, such as CPU frequency, memory allocation, and network configuration, to suit the specific requirements of their projects.

9,Comparative,What is the difference between a Floating IP and a Private IP?,"On Chameleon, Private IPs and Floating IPs serve distinct networking purposes :   

Private IP (Fixed IP): This is an IP address assigned to an instance for communication within Chameleon's internal network (e.g., sharednet1). It is not directly reachable from the public internet. Instances use their private IP to communicate with each other and to initiate outbound connections to the internet through a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway.   

Floating IP: This is a publicly routable IPv4 address that can be dynamically associated with an instance. A Floating IP is required for an instance to be directly accessible from the public internet (for example, to connect via SSH from your laptop or to host a public web server). Floating IPs are a limited, shared resource, so users are encouraged to release them when they are no longer needed. ",model_14_answer,"Here is the refined answer:

A Floating IP address is an IP address that can be accessed over the public Internet, whereas a Private IP address cannot. A Floating IP is assigned to your instance from Chameleon's public IP pool and is used for external communication with your instance.

On the other hand, a Private IP address is an internal IP address only accessible within the testbed network. It is not routable over the Internet and is used for communication between nodes or services within the same project.

To access your instance from outside the testbed (e.g., via SSH), you need to assign a Floating IP address to it. If you're communicating with other nodes or services within the same project, a Private IP address will suffice.

10,Comparative,When should I use an FPGA node versus a GPU node?,"While the Chameleon documentation does not provide a direct comparison, the choice between an FPGA and a GPU depends on the specific requirements of your research, based on the fundamental differences in their architectures :   

Use a GPU Node for: High-throughput, data-parallel computations. GPUs contain thousands of cores optimized for performing the same operation on large amounts of data simultaneously. This makes them exceptionally well-suited for the matrix and vector operations that dominate deep learning model training and inference, scientific simulations, and high-performance computing (HPC).   

Use an FPGA Node for: Latency-critical or power-sensitive applications requiring custom hardware logic. An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is a fabric of reconfigurable logic blocks, not a fixed set of cores. This allows you to design and implement a custom digital circuit optimized for a specific algorithm. FPGAs can offer advantages in low-latency processing (e.g., network packet processing, real-time signal processing), power efficiency, and for prototyping novel hardware accelerators before committing to a final chip design (ASIC).",model_14_answer,"When deciding between using an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) node and a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) node on Chameleon, consider the following factors:

1.  **Compute-intensive tasks**: If your application requires massive parallel processing, such as deep learning, scientific simulations, or data analytics, GPUs are generally more suitable due to their high throughput and specialized architecture.
2.  **Custom hardware acceleration**: FPGAs excel at accelerating specific tasks that require custom hardware implementation, like cryptographic operations, network processing, or signal processing. If your application benefits from customized hardware acceleration, an FPGA node might be a better choice.
3.  **Low latency and real-time processing**: FPGAs are often used in applications requiring low latency and real-time processing, such as high-frequency trading, audio/video processing, or control systems. In these cases, the predictable and deterministic nature of FPGA-based processing can be beneficial.
4.  **Power efficiency**: FPGAs typically consume less power than GPUs for similar workloads, making them a more energy-efficient option for applications with strict power constraints.

12,How-To,How do I attach a volume to my running instance?,"You can attach a persistent block storage volume to a running virtual machine on the KVM@TACC site. This feature is not available for bare metal nodes. The process is done through the GUI :   

Navigate to the Volumes > Volumes page in the KVM@TACC dashboard.

Locate the volume you wish to attach in the list. In its ""Actions"" dropdown menu, select Manage Attachments.

In the dialog box that appears, select your running instance from the dropdown menu.

Click the Attach Volume button.

After the volume is attached, you must log in to the instance via SSH to partition, format, and mount the new block device before you can use it.",model_14_answer,"To attach a volume to your running instance, follow these steps:

First, navigate to the ""Volumes"" overview under ""Volumes > Volumes"" in the sidebar. Select the action arrow next to the volume you want to attach and click ""Attach Volume"". On the ""Manage Volumes Attachments"" dialog, pick your instance from the dropdown and confirm by clicking ""Attach Volume"".

Alternatively, you can also use the Python-chi tool to manage volumes via Python. See this Trovi artifact for more information on how to do this.

13,Factual Recall,What is the maximum duration for a single lease reservation?,"The standard maximum duration for a single lease reservation that can be created through the web interface is seven days.   

However, there is some flexibility. You can extend an active lease for another seven days as long as you do so within 48 hours of its expiration and no other user has already reserved the hardware for that time. In exceptional circumstances where a longer, continuous reservation is required for an experiment, you can open a ticket with the help desk to request a special exception.",model_14_answer,"The maximum duration for a single lease reservation on Chameleon Cloud is indeed 7 days.

14,Negative Question,Can I use my Chameleon allocation to mine cryptocurrency?,"No, you cannot. Chameleon's Acceptable Use Policy explicitly prohibits running applications that mine cryptocurrency or use blockchain technology for personal financial gain.   

As a publicly funded research instrument supported by the National Science Foundation, Chameleon resources must be used exclusively for research and educational work. Cryptocurrency mining is considered a commercial or personal-gain activity that consumes significant resources and is therefore outside the testbed's mission. An exception may be granted for legitimate    

research into blockchain technology, but this requires advance, explicit approval from the Chameleon team.",model_14_answer,"You cannot use your Chameleon allocation for mining cryptocurrency. According to the Getting Started guide on the Chameleon Cloud Documentation, ""We never recommend changing firewall rules, and there is no need to mess with security groups unless you are using the KVM cloud."" This implies that any activity that requires modifying firewall rules or security groups may be against the terms of use.

Additionally, the FAQ section does not mention cryptocurrency mining as a valid use case for Chameleon. In fact, the FAQ explicitly states that ""You can read more about Chameleon here"" which suggests that the primary purpose of Chameleon is for computer science research and education.

The Practical Reproducibility Opportunity page on the Chameleon website also emphasizes the importance of reproducibility in research, suggesting that users should aim to create an image that encapsulates their experimental environment, which can be easily redeployed by others. This implies that the testbed is intended for collaborative research and experimentation, rather than for personal gain or activities like cryptocurrency mining.

Therefore, it is likely that using your Chameleon allocation for mining cryptocurrency would be against the terms of use and may result in your account being suspended or terminated.

15,Complex Query,How can I set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node?,"Chameleon's support for ""deep reconfigurability"" allows you to install and boot from a custom kernel on a bare metal node. The general process is as follows :   

Launch an Instance: Start by launching an instance from a ""whole disk image."" Most of the standard Chameleon-provided OS images (e.g., CC-Ubuntu20.04) are whole disk images suitable for this purpose.

Install Your Kernel: Once the instance is running, connect to it via SSH. Transfer your custom kernel and its associated modules to the instance and install them.

Modify the Bootloader: With root privileges, edit the bootloader configuration file (e.g., /boot/grub2/grub.cfg). Add a new menu entry that points to your new kernel and ramdisk files. You can also specify any custom kernel command-line parameters in this entry.

Reboot: Reboot the node. It will now boot using your specified custom kernel.

Note that for the cc-snapshot tool to work correctly with your custom environment, the size of your kernel's modules directory (/lib/modules/<kernel_version>) must be less than 4GB. ",model_14_answer,"To set up an experiment that requires a specific kernel version on a bare metal node in Chameleon, you'll need to follow these steps:

1.  **Create or Join a Project**: Before launching your instance, ensure you're part of an active project. If not, create one if you're eligible to be a PI (Principal Investigator) or join an existing project.
2.  **Choose Your Hardware**: Use the **Hardware Discovery Catalog** to search and filter for hardware across all Chameleon sites based on multiple criteria, including memory, thread count, CPUs, GPUs, and more. This catalog is the best place to start your hardware discovery.
3.  **Select a Bare Metal Node**: Once you've chosen your hardware, select a bare metal node that meets your requirements. Make sure it has the necessary resources for your experiment.
4.  **Set Up Key Pairs**: Before launching an instance, ensure you can connect to it by setting up key pairs. This will allow you to securely access your instance.
5.  **Launch Your Instance**: With your project and hardware selected, launch your bare metal instance. You'll need to specify the kernel version required for your experiment.

To set a specific kernel version on a bare metal node:

*   In the Chameleon portal, navigate to the ""Launch"" page for your chosen instance.
*   Under the ""Advanced Options"" section, select the kernel version from the dropdown menu or enter it manually in the format `kernel-version`.
*   Proceed with launching your instance.

If you're using Python-chi 1.0, you can also use the library to script your Chameleon experiments and set a specific kernel version programmatically.

16,Conceptual,What is the Trovi artifacts repository?,"Trovi is Chameleon's sharing portal and repository for digital research artifacts. Its primary purpose is to facilitate    

reproducible science by allowing users to package, share, and discover complete experiments.   

An artifact in Trovi is more than just code; it's a ""compute capsule"" that can contain a collection of components, including :   

Jupyter notebooks that orchestrate the experiment.

Links to the specific custom disk images needed.

Heat orchestration templates for multi-node deployments.

Datasets and documentation.

This packaging allows another researcher to find an experiment on Trovi and, with a single click, launch it directly on Chameleon to verify, replicate, or build upon the work.",model_14_answer,"Here is the refined answer:

Trovi is an open-source service for packaging and sharing reproducible artifacts designed for testbeds. It serves as a flexible, standards-based service that can be adapted for various testbeds, not just Chameleon-specific repositories. Currently, over 200 artifacts have been shared publicly on Trovi by Chameleon users.

These artifacts serve diverse purposes, including educational modules, reproducible storage research, and experiment patterns showcasing testbed capabilities. When used with Chameleon, Trovi integrates seamlessly, allowing you to ""launch"" artifacts into a JupyterLab environment that automatically authenticates you and comes pre-equipped with commonly used libraries.

Trovi enables users to share digital research and education artifacts, such as packaged experiments, workshop tutorials, or class materials. Each artifact is represented as a deposition (a remotely accessible folder) where users can store Jupyter notebooks, links to images, orchestration templates, data, software, and other digital representations that together represent a focused contribution.

17,How-To,How do I launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates?,"You can automate the deployment of complex, multi-node topologies using OpenStack's Heat orchestration service. The process uses a declarative YAML file called a Heat Orchestration Template (HOT).   

Here is the workflow to launch a multi-node ""stack"" :   

Create a Reservation: First, you must have an active lease with enough nodes to accommodate your entire deployment (e.g., if your template defines 1 server and 3 clients, you need a reservation for at least 4 nodes).

Navigate to Orchestration: In the Chameleon dashboard, go to Project > Orchestration > Stacks.

Launch Stack: Click the Launch Stack button.

Select Template: Specify your Heat template. You can upload the YAML file, paste its contents directly, or provide a URL to a template hosted online.

Enter Parameters: The interface will prompt you to enter values for any parameters defined in the template. This will always include a name for the stack, your password, the ID of your reservation, and an SSH key. It may also include custom parameters, like the number of client nodes to create.

Launch: Click Launch. Heat will then automatically provision all the resources—instances, networks, routers, etc.—as defined in your template.",model_14_answer,"Here is the refined answer:

To launch multiple nodes with one command using Heat templates, you can use the `server_group` resource in your template. This will allow you to specify a group of instances that should be launched together.

19,Troubleshooting,"Why can't my instance access the internet, even with a floating IP?","The most common reason an instance with a floating IP cannot be accessed from the internet is due to the host-based firewall running on the instance itself.   

Chameleon's supported operating system images (like Ubuntu and CentOS) are pre-configured with firewalld enabled by default for security. This firewall has restrictive rules that block most incoming connections from the public internet.   

To solve this, you must connect to your instance (e.g., via the web-based console) and explicitly open the ports for the services you need. For example, to allow incoming HTTP traffic, you would run a command like:
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
Followed by:
sudo firewall-cmd --reload",model_14_answer,"If your instance is unable to access the internet despite having a floating IP, there are several potential causes. First, ensure that your security group allows incoming ICMP (ping) traffic and SSH (TCP port 22) traffic. By default, firewall rules do not allow ping or SSH to instances.

Another possible cause is floating IP pool exhaustion at CHI@UC. If you're experiencing issues with floating IPs in this region, try allocating a floating IP from the reservable address pool by making a lease for one.

Additionally, if you have set up a bastion host, ensure that it is properly configured and allows incoming traffic on the required ports.

To troubleshoot further, check your instance's firewall rules and security group settings to ensure they allow necessary traffic. You can also try releasing and re-associating the floating IP or checking for any network issues in the region where your instance is located.

20,Complex Query,How can I repeat a networking experiment I found on the Chameleon blog to ensure reproducibility?,"Chameleon provides a complete ecosystem to ensure experiments can be easily reproduced. If an experiment from the blog was packaged for reproducibility, the process would be :   

Find the Artifact on Trovi: The experiment should be packaged as an ""artifact"" on the Trovi sharing portal. This artifact bundles all the necessary components: the Jupyter notebook that orchestrates the experiment, links to the custom disk images containing the required software, and any necessary configuration scripts or data.   

Launch the Jupyter Notebook: From the Trovi page, you can launch the artifact directly into Chameleon's Jupyter environment.

Execute the Notebook: The notebook will contain executable code cells that use Chameleon's Python library (python-chi) to programmatically handle the entire experimental lifecycle. This includes reserving the correct type of hardware, launching instances from the specific custom image, configuring the required networking (e.g., isolated VLANs), running the experiment, and collecting the results.   

Use Daypass for Access (if needed): If you don't have a Chameleon account, the experiment's author can grant you temporary, scoped access to the testbed using the Daypass feature, allowing you to run the artifact and reproduce the results",model_14_answer,"Here is the refined answer:

To repeat a networking experiment on the Chameleon testbed and ensure reproducibility, follow these steps. First, identify the specific experiment you want to replicate from the Chameleon blog. Then, access the Chameleon testbed through your Jupyter Notebook by following the instructions in the ""Changelog for September 2023"" section of the Chameleon blog.

Next, document and save your experiment similarly in notebook form using Trovi, as described in the same section. This will enable you to easily share your experiment with collaborators or publish it for other Chameleon users to build upon.

To ensure reproducibility, create an image that encapsulates your experimental environment by following Nanqinqin Li's instructions in the ""Chameleon User Experiments"" blog post. This will allow you to snapshot your experiment and make it easily redeployable on remote testbed resources.

Additionally, consider packaging your experiment for practical reproducibility by following the instructions provided in the ""Practical Reproducibility Opportunity"" section of the Chameleon blog. This will enable others to run your experiment with one-click using the Trovi artifact repository.

We’re excited your here.\\nGet a head start on leveraging the power of Chameleon for your research\\nprojects by following our guide below.\\nAt the end of this tutorial, you will have learned how to:\\n\\nCreate a free user account on Chameleon and link it with your own\\ninstitution Single Sign-On (SSO) through the Globus Auth service.\\nApply for a project on Chameleon and add users to projects.\\nUse Chameleon’s Hardware Discovery Catalog and the Host Calendars to search for available hardware that meets your\\nresearch needs.\\nReserve Chameleon resources using leases.\\nConfigure, launch, and connect to an instance running on a bare metal server.\\n\\nLet’s get started!\\n\\nNote\\nIf you already have a Chameleon account and project, you can skip the pre-reqs\\nto this section below.\\n\\n\\n\\nPre-Req: Creating a Chameleon Account\\nPre-Req: Create or Join a Project\\nStart Using Chameleon Hardware\\n\\nWarm Up: Pick Your Hardware\\nMy First Reservation: Reseving a Node\\n\\nStep 1: Access a Testbed Site\\nStep 2: Go to the Reservations Dashboard\\nStep 3: Creating a New Lease\\n\\n\\nMy First Instance: Launching an Instance\\n\\nStep 1: Go to the Instances Dashboard\\nStep 2: Create a New Instance\\n\\n\\nFirst Contact: Associating an IP Address & SSH\\n\\nStep 1: Associate an IP\\nStep 2: Accessing Your Instance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRemix: JupyterHub and python-chi\\n\\nJupyter on Chameleon\\nTrovi\\nGetting Started with python-chi: Bare Metal Experiment Pattern\\n\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\n\\n\\nPre-Req: Creating a Chameleon Account\\uf0c1\\nBefore you can use Chameleon, you need to create a free user account.\\nCreating an account is easy! Simply go to the Chameleon home page and click\\n“Log In” at the top right corner. You’ll be redirected to our authentication\\npage where you can sign up using your institution credentials, Google account,\\nor other federated identity options.\\n\\nWe recommend using federated login (sign in via your institution) as it’s the\\nfastest way to get started and helps with PI eligibility verification if you plan\\nto create projects later.\\n\\nNote\\nNeed detailed login help? See our comprehensive federated authentication guide\\nfor step-by-step instructions, authentication options, and troubleshooting tips.\\n\\nOnce you log in, you can edit your Chameleon profile and\\nparticipate in our community. However, to actually use the testbed you’ll first\\nneed to join or create a project. Let’s learn how!\\n\\n\\nPre-Req: Create or Join a Project\\uf0c1\\nTo use Chameleon resources, you need to be a member of an active project. Projects are\\nworkspaces that provide compute allocations and manage team access to testbed resources.\\nThere are two ways to get project access:\\n\\nOption 1: Create a New Project (if you’re eligible to be a PI)\\nRequires PI eligibility status on Chameleon\\nSee our PI eligibility guide for requirements\\nGraduate students typically need their advisor to create the project\\n\\n\\nOption 2: Join an Existing Project (most common for new users)\\nAsk a current project member to add you\\nProvide your Chameleon username (found in your profile)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote\\nNew to projects? Read our comprehensive project management guide\\nfor details on project concepts, user roles, allocations, and management.\\n\\n\\n\\nStart Using Chameleon Hardware\\uf0c1\\nCongratulations, you are now ready to launch your first instance! Instances are\\nmuch like what you may expect to find in a virtual machine, except here the\\ninstances are on bare metal nodes - the core feature of Chameleon 😎. A bare\\nmetal node is a whole physical server to which you, and you alone, have\\nexclusive root access.\\n\\nNote\\nChameleon also offers a multi-tenant, virtualized cloud, with fewer\\nfunctionalities and a smaller scale. See KVM for more details.\\n\\nBelow, we will walk through the steps on how to launch a bare metal instance using the\\ngraphical user interface (GUI) or web application on the Chameleon portal.\\nSee the final section to complete the same steps using Jupyter\\nand python-chi, Chameleon’s Python library with custom utilities to help with\\nexperiment orchestration.\\n\\nWarm Up: Pick Your Hardware\\uf0c1\\nChameleon resources are available at multiple sites, e.g., CHI@TACC and\\nCHI@UC. Check out our Hardware Discovery Catalog, where you can search and\\nfilter for hardware across all Chameleon sites based on multiple criteria,\\nincluding memory, thread count, CPUs, GPUs, and more. This catalog is the best\\nplace to start your hardware discovery.\\n\\n\\nImportant\\nChameleon resources are available per site, which means that you must\\nuse a specific site to access certain hardware.\\nChameleon Infrastructure (CHI) is offered at the following main sites:\\n\\nTexas Advanced Computing Center (TACC): Austin, TX - CHI@TACC\\nUniversity of Chicago (UC): Chicago, IL - CHI@UC\\n\\nFor example, if you want to use a GPU v100 node, you must use the CHI@UC\\nsite, which is the only site where the node is available. Some hardware is\\navailable at multiple sites, but it is always a good idea to check where\\nyour preferred hardware is located to save yourself some confusion or\\ntrouble later down the line.\\n\\nIn this getting started demo, we will work with the Compute Cascadelake R\\nnodes (see, e.g. here)\\navailable through both the CHI@UC and CHI@TACC sites. These nodes are\\nplentiful on the platform and tend to be available on demand (which is\\nconvenient for a demo!). However, bear in mind that you can follow this same\\nguide to reserve any hardware on Chameleon.\\nOnce we have found the hardware we want to use and the site where it is\\nlocated, we are now ready to make our first reservation!\\n\\n\\nMy First Reservation: Reseving a Node\\uf0c1\\nOn Chameleon, as opposed to other testbeds or commerical clouds, you must\\nreserve your resources before you can launch an instance on them. Chameleon\\nsupports both on-demand and advanced reservations. We will use an on-demand\\nreservation for this guide, but note that you can reserve resources in advance,\\nwhich is often necessary to get access to popular, scarce hardware like GPUs.\\n\\nStep 1: Access a Testbed Site\\uf0c1\\nAs mentioned above, different Chameleon sites have different hardware. To log\\nin to a Chameleon site from the main Chameleon portal page, click on the\\n“Experiment” tab on the nav bar at the top. From the dropdown, select a\\nChameleon site. We will be working with nodes available in either CHI@UC\\nor CHI@TACC, so you can select one of those.\\n\\n\\n\\nSelect a site to use.\\uf0c1\\n\\n\\nWhen you access one of the sites, you are first taken to a site dashboard,\\nwhich shows a summary of your project’s current resource usage. The dashboard\\nlooks something like this:\\n\\n\\n\\nAn overview of your project’s current resource usage\\uf0c1\\n\\n\\nOnce on your dashboard on the site, notice that the URL has changed to a\\nspecific domain for the testbed site we chose. You can also see which site you\\nare currently on by clicking on the dropdown next to the Chameleon logo at the\\ntop left of the window.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis section tells you which project you are currently using and which site. By\\nclicking on the dropdown menu, you can change to another Chameleon site or\\nchange to another project.\\n\\nImportant\\nProjects will only appear as an option in this menu if they have a current\\nactive allocation of compute resources.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 2: Go to the Reservations Dashboard\\uf0c1\\nWe need to reserve a Cascadelake R node for our use. From the main page of\\nour testbed site, we can select the “Reservations” menu item on the side nav\\nbar and then click “Leases.” Doing so will open a new page showing a table of\\nyour lease activity. If you are a first-time user of Chameleon, the table will\\nbe blank. Let’s change that now!\\n\\n\\nStep 3: Creating a New Lease\\uf0c1\\nBefore we create a lease, it is a good idea to check the Host Calendars available on the Leases page to see if another user has\\nthe hardware reserved.\\n\\n\\n\\nClick the “Host Calendar” button now. You will be taken to a new page with a\\nGnatt chart.\\n\\nEach row in the chart represents a node of the specific “Node Type” specified\\nat the top of the calendar. You can change this to display the calendar for\\ndifferent node types.\\n\\nAttention\\n“Node Types” available in the filter menu will be restricted by site. You will\\nonly see node types available for the specific site that you are currently\\nusing.\\n\\nOur preferred node type is available on demand, so let’s navigate back to our\\nLeases (“Reservations -> Leases”) page to create a new lease. Click the “Create\\nLease” button in the top right corner of the page.\\n\\n\\n\\nClicking this button will then open a web form. Let’s go through the web form\\nstep by step.\\nGeneral\\n\\n\\n\\nSpecify your lease name and duration.\\uf0c1\\n\\n\\nIn this section, add a name for your lease (my-first-lease). To\\ncreate an on-demand lease, we can click next, because the form will\\nauto-populate with defaults for the duration of the lease (the default is a\\none-day lease that starts immediately). If you want to change the duration of\\nyour lease or to make an advanced reservation, you can input the start date and\\ntime, number of days (maximum 7 days), and the end time.\\nHosts\\n\\n\\n\\nSpecify the number and type of host.\\uf0c1\\n\\n\\nOn the next section, you can specify the hardware that you want to\\ninclude in your lease. You must check the box “Reserve Hosts” and fill out the\\nrequired fields. We will start with just one node and will set the minimum and\\nmaximum number of hosts to 1. In the Resource Property field, we can use\\ndifferent attributes of Chameleon resources (such as “node type”) to specify\\nthe exact kind of hardware we want to reserve with this lease. We can add\\nmultiple fitlers with different properties, but we only care about the node\\ntype right now.\\n\\nImportant\\nIf you specify resource properties that return more than one node matching the filter that is available for your specified duration, the system will automatically select a node for you. If you want to specify the precise node that you want to use, you will need to refer to the Node ID and use the Resource Property filter to specify that node ID.\\n\\nNetworks\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, select your network reservation options.\\uf0c1\\n\\n\\nOn the final section of the lease form, you can reserve network\\nresources. If your research requires setting up an isolated network for a\\ncluster of nodes, you may want to reserve a network by clicking the “Reserve\\nNetwork” box. You will almost certainly want to reserve a Floating IP for your\\nreservation. Floating IP addresses are used to connect to an instance over the\\ninternet. There is typically no need to reserve more than one per-project for a\\ngiven site. If there are no floating IPs available, try taking an ad-hoc IP (no\\nreservation required)\\n\\nNote\\nFloating IPs can also be allocated to your project after creating a lease.\\nHowever, the pool of allocable IPs can occasionally dry up. We encourage users\\nto reserve floating IPs when making their hardware reservations, as it ensures\\nthat you will receive an IP.\\n\\nSUBMIT!\\n\\nClick “Create”. Chameleon provides bare metal access to nodes. When you create\\na reservation for one or more nodes, only you and other users on your project\\nwill be able to use those nodes for the time specified.\\nThe reservation will start shortly, at which point you can launch an instance\\non a bare metal node.\\nWhen the lease is created, it will appear on your Leases page with a status of\\n“PENDING.” Once the lease is active, the status will change to “ACTIVE” and you\\nwill then be able to start using the lease. You can click on the lease name to\\nview more details about your lease.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImportant\\nDo not attempt to stack reservations to circumvent the 7-day lease\\nlimitation. Your leases may be deleted. Please refer to our best practices\\nif you require a longer reservation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy First Instance: Launching an Instance\\uf0c1\\nOnce the lease that you created becomes “ACTIVE,” you can launch a bare metal\\ninstance on the node that has been leased to you. In the following steps, we\\nwill walk through how to configure and launch an instance on the reserved\\nhardware. In the GUI, this process will feel similar to the process we just\\nfollowed to create a new lease. You will specify your instance details in a\\nform and submit it to the system. Chameleon will then automatically configure,\\nbuild, and launch your instance.\\n\\nNote\\nBuilding and launching an instance on bare metal (especially when using beefy appliances and images) can take a long time. After creating your instance, you may need to wait for 10 to 20 minutes before the instance will be running.\\n\\nTo create a new instance, follow the steps below:\\n\\nStep 1: Go to the Instances Dashboard\\uf0c1\\nIn the sidebar from your site dasboard, click Compute, then click Instances\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 2: Create a New Instance\\uf0c1\\nClick on the Launch Instance button in the toolbar and the Launch\\nInstance wizard will load.\\nDetails\\n\\n\\n\\nEnter the main details about your instance, including which reservation to use.\\uf0c1\\n\\n\\nGive your instance a descriptive name (my-first-instance) and a short\\ndescription (optional). You will also need to specify the lease that you\\nwill use for this instance. You can select the reservation that you just\\ncreated from the dropdown. We can also specify how many instances we want to\\nlaunch. The default is one and we have one node so we’ll stick with that.\\nSource\\n\\n\\n\\nSelect your image source.\\uf0c1\\n\\n\\nIn the next section, we can configure a source that we will use for our\\ninstance. This can be an image, a snapshotted image, a volume, or some other\\nappliance. Chameleon staff maintain some images for users (identified with a\\nChameleon badge). There are also user-uploaded images and appliances. For\\nour demo, we’ll use the supported CC-Ubuntu20.04 image. We can see a list\\nof all available images below on this section. If we scroll down, we can\\nfind the image and click the up arrow icon next to our desired image. This\\nwill tell the system to use them image for the instance source.\\nNetworks\\n\\n\\n\\nAllocate a network.\\uf0c1\\n\\n\\nOn the next section, we can allocate a network to provide communication\\nchannels for instances in the cloud. Chameleon currently offers two\\npublic networks, sharednet1 and fabnetv4. We will use the sharednet1, which\\nis the default network for providing connectivity to a Chameleon instance.\\nThe fabnetv4 network is specifically for accessing the FABRIC testbed\\nresources from Chameleon sites and from cross-site stitching. Read more\\nhere! We will use the sharednet1 since we aren’t doing any fancy\\nnetworking right now.\\nKey Pairs\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd a key pair to the instance.\\uf0c1\\n\\n\\nAs a final step to create our instance, we can set up a key pair. We absolutely\\nneed to add a key pair if we want to remotely access the instance after it is\\nrunning.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo add a key pair, we can either add a new one using “Create Key Pair” and\\nstoring the credentials on our local machine, or import an existing key using\\nthe “Import Key Pair”. If you have previously uploaded a key pair to Chameleon,\\nthis key pair will appear in the “Available” section below. You can then reuse\\nthat key pair.\\nFinally, we are ready to click “Launch Instance”. Doing so will take us back\\nto our Instances page, where we should see a new row for the instance that\\nwe just created. We can see most of the important information about our\\ninstance from here. However, we can also click on the instance name (like\\nwith a lease) to view more details.\\nThe detailed page gives you an overview of the instance. There are also other\\noptions to view logs, open a console (once the instance is running), and more.\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst Contact: Associating an IP Address & SSH\\uf0c1\\nYour instance may take approximately ten to fifteen minutes to launch depending\\non the node type. The launch process includes powering up, loading the\\noperating system over the network, and booting up for the first time on a rack\\nlocated either at the University of Chicago or the Texas Advanced Computing\\nCenter, depending on where you chose to launch your instance. Before you can\\naccess your instance, you need to first assign a floating IP address - an IP\\naddress that is accessible over the public Internet.\\n\\nStep 1: Associate an IP\\uf0c1\\nTo associate an IP address with your instance, follow these steps. Note, it is\\nbest to wait until your instance is running before doing this step to ensure no\\nissues.\\n\\nGo to the Floating IP dashboard by clicking on Network and Floating IPs\\nin the sidebar.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you have a Floating IP not currently associated to an instance, click the\\nAssociate button for the IP. A dialog will load that allows you to assign a\\npublicly accessible IP to your instance. Click the Associate button in the\\ndialog to complete the process of associating the public IP to your instance.\\n\\n\\n\\nHere you can assign a floating IP address\\uf0c1\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you didn’t already have a Floating IP available, you may allocate one to\\nyour project by clicking on the Allocate IP to Project button along the top\\nrow in the Floating IP dashboard. A new dialog will open for allocating the\\nfloating IP.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis dialog allows you to allocate an IP address from Chameleon’s public\\nIP pool\\uf0c1\\n\\n\\nClick the Allocate IP button. The Floating IP dashboard will reload and you\\nshould see your new Floating IP appear in the list. You can now go back to\\nstep 2.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 2: Accessing Your Instance\\uf0c1\\nOnce your instance has launched with an associated floating IP address, it can\\nbe accessed via SSH using the private key that you added when creating an\\ninstance.\\n\\nNote\\nThe following instructions assume that you are using a macOS or Linux\\nterminal equivalent. You may view our YouTube video on how to login via SSH\\non Windows.\\n\\nTo log in to your instance with SSH, follow these steps:\\n\\nOpen a terminal window and find the path of your identify file. My key is\\nnamed chamkey.\\nRun the command below from your terminal and specify the path to your key\\npair file. You must use the private key to connect.

You just created your first Chameleon instance!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRemix: JupyterHub and python-chi\\uf0c1\\nWe just walked through how to find hardware, reserve resources, and configure\\nour instances on Chameleon. We did all of this through the web application\\ninterface or GUI that you can access through the Chameleon portal. This\\ninterface is a great place to start, as it provides lots of context and helpful\\nhints to guide you through the core features of Chameleon.\\nHowever, you might find the process a bit tedious. Perhaps, you wonder, there\\nis a way to do all this programatically without needing to touch the web\\napplication. Well, you’re in luck! Because Chameleon offers just such an\\ndevelopment environment along with a trusty tool to accommodate!\\nIn this last section of our Getting Started guide, we will briefly touch on how\\nto do the exact same thing we did above through a Jupyter Notebook connected to\\nthe testbed compute environment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJupyter on Chameleon\\uf0c1\\nChameleon is integrated with JupyterHub, so you can launch a\\nJupyter server (on KVM) with an environment pre-configured with python-chi and\\nauthentication to the testbed. JupyterHub on Chameleon allows you to create\\nJupyter Notebooks with your experiment and analysis code, collaborate with\\nother project members in a common testbed workspace, and share files as Trovi\\nartifacts with the Chameleon community.\\nTo read more about the Jupyter interface, see our docs on the\\ninterface.\\nTo launch the Jupyter interface on Chameleon, go to the Chameleon home page,\\nclick on the “Experiment” tab, and select the “Jupyter Interface” item. This\\nwill launch a new window which will begin loading the Jupyter server. It will\\nthen launch the JupyterHub interface. This interface should be familiar if\\nyou’ve ever worked with Jupyter tools before. From the launch page, we can\\ncreate new notebooks, open consoles, and even open a terminal.\\nThe work that you do in this space is persistent, so if you create a new\\nnotebook and then exit the interface and relaunch it, the notebook will still\\nappear in your file system.\\n\\n\\n\\nJupyter Interface will start a server.\\uf0c1\\n\\n\\nYou can also download and import files from Jupyter as well as integrate with\\ngit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTrovi\\uf0c1\\nOne benefit of having an interface like Jupyter available is that users can use\\nit to package their project materials, scripts, code, and datasets as artifacts\\nthat others can replicate and extend. So, how does Chameleon facilitate this\\nsharing?\\nChameleon provides the Trovi service as a repository to share and access\\nartifacts from other users on the testbed. Trovi is integrated with the Jupyter\\nInterface, so you can launch Trovi artfacts directly onto the Jupyter Interface\\nand start using them. You can also take your Jupyter artfacts and upload them\\nto Trovi from Jupyter, allowing others to see and use them.\\nTo get to the Trovi repository from the Chameleon home page, go to the\\n“Experiment” tab and click the “Trovi” menu item. Here, you can see all the\\npublic artifacts available on the testbed.\\n\\nChameleon offers tutorials and experimental pattern notebooks on Trovi. We’ll\\nuse one now to see how we can accomplish the same basic set up on Chameleon\\nthat we achieved in our previous section.\\nGo to the Trovi repository (after logging in to the site if you aren’t\\nalready). The artifact we will use today is called the Bare Metal Experiment\\nPattern. You can type “Bare Metal” in the search bar to filter the results.\\nYou can also filter for this artifact by selecting the Chameleon badge icon\\n() on the side bar to view all of the Chameleon-supported\\nartifacts. We can also filter by tag, for example the “experiment pattern” tag.\\n\\nNote\\nThere are additional artifacts to check out that will help you with more\\nadvanced topics. And the best part about these templates is that we can easily\\nreuse the code to start our own artifacts.\\n\\nTo launch the artifact, click on the title. On the next page, you will see the following:\\n\\nClick on the “Launch on Chameleon” button to start Jupyter. This loading page\\nshould look familiar to the loading page when we launched the Jupyter Interface\\nabove.\\nOnce Jupyter has loaded, we will have the artifact directory available in our\\nworkspace. Your directory should include the following files:\\n$ ls\\nAnalysis.ipynb             Experiment.ipynb   out            run_experiment.sh\\nlatest.tar.gz      README.ipynb   setup.sh\\n\\n\\nWe can click on the directory and open the README.ipynb file, which\\nprovides some documentation on this artifact, including approximately how long\\nit takes to run and any additional requirements.\\nLet’s now open the Experiment.ipynb file.\\n\\n\\nGetting Started with python-chi: Bare Metal Experiment Pattern\\uf0c1\\n\\nJupyter Notebook allows developers to mix text (rendered as Markdown) and code\\nin one file. This mixture of content enhances the experience of running code,\\nbecause documentation can be provided to clarify the code blocks that run. We\\ncan see at the start of the notebook a few blocks of text. If we scroll down to\\nthe “Configuration” section, we will see our first block of code. Let’s dive\\nin!\\nSetting the Site and Project\\nAs required when working through the Chameleon GUI, we need to set our active\\nproject and pick a testbed site to use before we can continue. This requires a\\nChameleon account and membership to an active project.\\nOnce we have our project and site, we can use python-chi to set these parameters.\\nimport chi\\n\\nchi.use_site(\"CHI@UC\")\\n\\n# Change to your project (CHI-XXXXXX)\\nchi.set(\"project_name\", \"Chameleon\")\\n\\n\\nThis code imports the python-chi module, calls the use_site method with\\nthe desired site (CHI@UC) inputted as a string, and calls the set method\\nto update the configuration to use our project code. (Note: this is necessary\\nso that the system knows which project to reference when creating leases and\\nlaunching instances.) Replace Chameleon with your project code.\\nCreate a Reservation\\n\\nNote\\npython-chi does not currently support hardware discovery, but we are\\nworking to fix that soon. Stay tuned!\\n\\nAfter we set our site and project code, we can now create a lease. The code\\nbelow uses the lease utility to create a reservation for one floating IP\\nand one bare metal host with the node type compute_cascadelake_r. Notice\\nthat we are setting the same parameters that we had to include in the form we\\nused to create a lease on the GUI.\\nfrom chi import lease\\n\\nreservations = []\\nlease_node_type = \"compute_cascadelake_r\"\\n\\ntry:\\n   print(\"Creating lease...\")\\n   lease.add_fip_reservation(reservations, count=1)\\n   lease.add_node_reservation(reservations, node_type=lease_node_type, count=1)\\n\\n   start_date, end_date = lease.lease_duration(hours=3)\\n\\n   l = lease.create_lease(\\n      f\"{os.getenv(\\'USER\\')}-power-management\",\\n      reservations,\\n      start_date=start_date,\\n      end_date=end_date\\n   )\\n\\n\\nWe can use the wait_for_active method to pause until our lease is active\\nbefore running further code cells in the notebook.\\nlease_id = l[\"id\"]\\nprint(\"Waiting for lease to start ...\")\\nlease.wait_for_active(lease_id)\\nprint(\"Lease is now active!\")\\n\\n\\nCreate an Instance\\nWe can now configure and launch our instance on the node that we reserved.\\nfrom chi import server\\n\\nimage = \"CC-CentOS8-stream\"\\n\\ns = server.create_server(\\n   f\"{os.getenv(\\'USER\\')}-power-management\",\\n   image_name=image,\\n   reservation_id=lease.get_node_reservation(lease_id)\\n)\\n\\nprint(\"Waiting for server to start ...\")\\nserver.wait_for_active(s.id)\\nprint(\"Done\")\\n\\n\\nThis code uses the server utility to spin up an instance. We can specify\\nwhich image we want to use by referring to it’s name (in this case\\nCC-CentOS8-stream). (To see the name of an image, you can look it up in the\\nAppliances Catalog.) We also need to provide the reservation ID from our\\nlease, which we can grab using the get_node_reservation method.\\n\\nNote\\nWe are not specifying a key pair here, because when you use Chameleon through\\nthe Jupyter Interface, a key pair is automatically generated in the Jupyter\\nenvironment and associated with your Chameleon account. By default, the\\ncreate_server method will include this key pair in any instance you create\\nfrom the Jupyter Interface and will use it in other methods that allow you to\\nSSH to the instance. You can specify a different key pair using the key_name\\n(str) parameter.\\n\\nSSHing and Running Scripts on the Instance\\nAfter our server is running (remember, this can take up to 20 minutes in some\\ncases; now is a good time to take a coffee ☕️ break), we can use the ssh\\nutility to connect to the instance.\\nfloating_ip = lease.get_reserved_floating_ips(lease_id)[0]\\nserver.associate_floating_ip(s.id, floating_ip_address=floating_ip)\\n\\nprint(f\"Waiting for SSH connectivity on {floating_ip} ...\")\\ntimeout = 60*2\\nimport socket\\nimport time\\n# Repeatedly try to connect via SSH.\\nstart_time = time.perf_counter()\\nwhile True:\\n   try:\\n      with socket.create_connection((floating_ip, 22), timeout=timeout):\\n            print(\"Connection successful\")\\n            break\\n   except OSError as ex:\\n      time.sleep(10)\\n      if time.perf_counter() - start_time >= timeout:\\n            print(f\"After {timeout} seconds, could not connect via SSH. Please try again.\")\\n\\nfrom chi import ssh\\n\\nwith ssh.Remote(floating_ip) as conn:\\n   # Upload the script\\n   conn.put(\"setup.sh\")\\n   # Run the script\\n   conn.run(\"bash setup.sh\")\\n\\n\\nWe have now associated our floating IP and verified our connection to the\\ninstance via the floating IP. We can then use our SSH connection to upload\\nscripts to set up our experiment, run it, and transfer the results back to our\\nlocal environment for processing and analysis. (See the Analysis.ipynb\\nnotebook to see the results of this experiment! Better yet, see if you can\\nreplicate the experiment in this tutorial on a different Node Type.)\\nCongratulations! You just created your second lease and instance on\\nChameleon - without ever leaving the comforts of your Jupyter Notebook!\\nBe sure to check out our additional tutorials on Trovi\\nto continue your learning!\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion\\uf0c1\\nThank you so much for completing our quickstart guide!

Chameleon is built over two sites, the University of Chicago and TACC, offering a total of over 550 nodes and 5 PB of space in twelve Standard Cloud Unit (SCU) racks. To effectively support Computer Science experiments, Chameleon offers bare metal reconfigurability on most of the hardware. To provide easy access to educational users, two SCUs at TACC (one sixth of the testbed) are configured with OpenStack KVM. You can read more about Chameleon here.\\n\\xa0\\nHow should I acknowledge\\xa0Chameleon?\\nAn acknowledgement of support from the Chameleon project and the National Science Foundation should appear in any publication of material, whether copyrighted or not, that describes work which benefited from access to Chameleon cyberinfrastructure resources. The suggested acknowledgement is as follows: “Results presented in this paper were obtained using the Chameleon testbed supported by the National Science Foundation”.\\nIn addition, it helps us a lot when you cite the Chameleon paper (see below).\\xa0<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">This\\xa0makes it much easier\\xa0for us to find the specific instances of research produced using Chameleon, and understand better how the testbed is used to support specific experiments.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nHow should I cite Chameleon?\\xa0\\nIf you use Chameleon in a publication, we would appreciate citations.

You can easily reach the help desk by submitting tickets through the help desk portal, visible next to your username on the Chameleon home page.\\nWe also offer users a Forum as a space for user discussion and non-urgent questions about using Chameleon Cloud that will be addressed on a best-effort basis. However, if you need help immediately, please reach out to our Help Desk.\\nProject and Allocation Management\\nHow do I apply for a Chameleon project?\\nProject applications may be filled out here. If you want to apply for a project you have to be PI eligible; if you fulfill the PI eligibility criteria but did not request PI eligibility when you applied for a Chameleon account you can request it by modifying options in your profile. An application for a project has to include a description of the research or education project to be performed using the testbed and the type of resources needed (see below). Each Chameleon project is awarded an allocation of service units for a specific amount of time. Users can expect a project decision within one business day.\\n\\xa0\\nMy PI/Professor/Colleague already has a Chameleon Project. How do I get added as a user on the project?\\nYou will need to contact the project PI and request that they add you as a user. Provide the PI with your Chameleon username. The project PI should visit the Chameleon Project Management page. From there, the PI may follow the instructions on how to manage users.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat are the units of an allocation, and how am I charged?\\nChameleon allocations can consist of several components of the system. Users can request allocation of individual compute nodes, storage servers, or complete Standard Cloud Unit (SCU) racks which contain compute servers, storage nodes, and an open flow switch.\\nCompute servers are allocated in Service Units (SUs), which equates to one hour of wall clock time on a single bare metal server. Note this unit differs from traditional HPC or cloud service units that are charged in core-hours; a Chameleon SU is a full server, as the type of experiments and performance measurements users may wish to do may be contaminated by sharing nodes.\\nStorage, GPU and FPGA nodes are also charged in SUs, at 2x the rate of compute servers (i.e., 1 hour allocation of 1 storage server == 2 SUs). SCU racks are charged at the rate of 50 SUs per wall clock hour (42 compute servers, 4 storage nodes, plus one OpenFlow switch).\\nAn allocation may make use of multiple SCUs, up to the size of the full testbed.\\nFor example, a user wishing to provision a 10 node cluster +1 storage server for a 1 week experiment should budget [(10 + 2) SUs per hour] * [7 days * 24 hours/day] = 2,016 SUs for that experiment.\\nNetwork resources are charged in SUs as well, at 1x the rate of compute servers, except for ExoGENI VLANs. For example, 1 hour allocation of 1 floating IP costs 1 SU. ExoGeni VLANs are charged at 4x the rate of compute servers.\\nSUs are charged the same regardless of use case\\xa0— you are charged for the fraction of the resource your experiment occupies, regardless of the type of the experiment.\\nThe basic principle for charging service units for Chameleon resources is to evaluate the amount of time a fraction of the resource is unavailable to other users. If a reservation is made through the portal for a particular date/time in the future, the user will be charged for this time regardless of whether the reservation is actually used, as the Chameleon scheduling system will have to drain the appropriate part of the system to satisfy the reservation, even if the nodes requested are not actually used. A reservation request may be cancelled in which case no charges will apply.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat are the project allocation sizes and limits?\\nIn the initial phase Chameleon is operating on a “soft allocation model” where each project, if approved, will receive a startup allocation of 20,000 SUs for six months that can be both recharged (i.e., more SUs can be added) and renewed (i.e., the duration can be extended) via submitting a renew/recharge request. This startup allocation value has been designed to respond to both PI needs (i.e., cover an amount of experimentation needed to obtain a significant result) and balance fairness to other users (it represents roughly 1% of testbed six months’ capacity). Requests for these startup projects will receive a fast track internal review (i.e., users can expect them to be approved within a few days).\\nA PI can apply for multiple projects/allocations; however, the number of held allocations will be taken into account during review.\\nAs our understanding of user need grows we expect the Chameleon allocation model to evolve towards closer reflection of those needs in the form of more differentiated allocations that will allow us to give larger allocations to users for longer time.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat is the allocation model for KVM virtual machines?\\nKVM resources do not use up your SU allocation, but projects are bound to the following resource limits on KVM:\\n\\n10 instances\\n20 VCPUs\\n50 GB RAM\\n10 volumes\\n50 floating IP addresses\\n\\nIf your project requires more resources than this, your quota can be increased upon request via the Help Desk.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat is the format of an allocation proposal?\\nA Chameleon Allocation request consists of the following components:\\n\\nProject Title\\nProject abstract describing the proposed experiments including the type of resources needed; this part is required and may be published on Chameleon website (~200 words)\\nSupplemental details; this is an optional extension of the project abstract, potentially including details that the PI does not wish to publish such as e.g., sources of funding that support the proposed research (500 words maximum)\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhat criteria is used to review project proposals?\\nRequests for projects and allocations are currently reviewed for merit by project operators with a future move towards review by independent review board composed of Chameleon Science Advisory Board members. The following criteria are used:\\n\\nPI eligibility\\nRelevance of the proposed experiment to cloud computing research; scientific merit and significance of the proposed experiments\\nDemonstrated need for Chameleon resources, methodology appropriate to the use of the Chameleon resource, justification of the requested allocation\\nSuccess of prior or other existing allocations (for renewals) in terms of published research results and new funding\\nTechnical feasibility (i.e, can the project succeed in the Chameleon environment?)\\nAny funded support for the project (optional, but we want to make certain that we give allocations to NSF CISE-supported cloud computing research!)\\n\\n\\xa0\\nPolicies\\nWhat are the security best practices on Chameleon?\\nThe security best practices are described in this article.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nWhat are the consequences of not following the security best practices and causing a security incident?\\nThe Chameleon team will terminate all instances involved in a security incident and place an\\xa0administrative lock on all interactions from the project under which the incident was caused that will last until the incident is resolved. This means that your negligence will affect not only you but also your collaborators on the project for the duration of the incident. Depending on the severity of incident Chameleon personnel may further suspend Chameleon access for anybody on the affected project for a week. In the case of repeat offenders Chameleon access will be withdrawn until further notice.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nWhat are the policies on Chameleon resource usage?\\nAllocation:\\nChameleon projects are granted allocations of \"service units\",\\xa0currently set to 20,000 service units for 6 months. Leases\\xa0are charged against the allocation\\'s balance of service units. Allocations can be renewed or extended. See the project management documentation for more details on Chameleon allocations\\nLeases:\\nSpecialized hardware on Chameleon can sometimes be in high demand and low supply. Like fishing boats sharing a pond, we must beware to avoid a tragedy of the commons and adopt community practices that encourage efficient and fair resource use.\\nTo ensure fairness to all users, resource reservations (leases) are subject to the following policies:\\n\\nA new lease cannot conflict with a pre-existing one, but can be scheduled in the future if needed.\\nYou can request a lease duration of up to 7 days.\\xa0\\nWithin 48 hours of lease expiry, you can request an extension, for up to an additional 7 days.\\xa0\\nKVM resources\\xa0do not\\xa0require a lease, and will remain active as long as your allocation is active.\\n\\nIn addition, we actively discourage “lease stacking”—the practice of obtaining multiple overlapping reservations for resources (e.g., compute instances, storage, or networking components) to extend project usage beyond typical limits or to ensure continuous access. Please do not try to circumvent the one week lease restriction by stacking leases. Engaging in such stacking could lead to resource hoarding, impacting the availability for other users. Our experience has shown that such conduct results in idle hardware capacity and creates negative incentives for all users to “overfish” the pond out of fear that others will do so first.\\nWe monitor the number and duration of leases across all projects for a given resource type. Projects with excessive reservations will be flagged for review. The project’s Principal Investigator (PI) will be contacted to provide justification or remove the violating leases within 3 business days. Failure to respond in a timely manner will result in the violating leases being terminated by Chameleon staff.\\nExceptions for extended access or intensive resource use may be granted for projects with significant computational needs, such as large-scale experiments and educational use cases. Users can submit exception requests through the Help Desk.\\nRequests for exceptions should be made by the Project\\'s PI and must detail the project’s goals, the need for additional resources, and how impact on the broader user community will be minimized.\\xa0If you require a longer lease\\xa0than 7 days or if you would like to extend your current lease, see the relevant FAQ items below.\\nExceptions will be made sparingly. Chameleon offers other tools and methods for saving your work at the end of a lease and automating relaunching on a new lease. See documentation on cc-snapshot (which simplifies the process of saving the state of a bare-metal instance) and our blog post on making instance snapshots on Chameleon.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat are the best practices for using Chameleon bare metal partitions?\\n\\nWhile it is possible to repeatedly request a lease for the same resource, we\\xa0Strongly\\xa0discourage this. Instead, save your work between leases using the CC-Snapshot instructions below.\\nDo not reserve more resources that you need at any given time. For example, if you need relatively few resources to develop something that you will then test at large scale, start with a small reservation for the development phase of your work and enlarge it later to test at scale – as opposed to making a large reservation up front.\\nAlways release the reservation if you will not use the testbed for an extended period of time. For example, when you leave for the weekend, holidays, or simply need to take a break from experimentation and analyze your experiment, the resources could be used by others.\\nAutomate creating your experimental environment. You can use scripting or some of the tools we provide that let you save your appliances/images between sessions (cc-snapshot ) or to orchestrate the deployment of complex environments (Complex Appliances) – if you need more ideas read our article on How to Make the Most of your Seven Day Lease. This will make reestablishing your experiment in a new lease easier and also makes it easier for you to reproduce your work and eventually share it with colleagues.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nWhat happens to my resources when my allocation expires?\\nNote: All retention periods are subject to the overall lifetime of the Chameleon project.\\nOnce your Chameleon allocation expires, resources are retained according to the following schedule:\\n\\nKVM instances: Automatically shutdown and offloaded to storage 48 hours after allocation expiration. After renewing your expired allocation, you will be able to unshelve and reload your instance. All KVM instances are deleted 1 year after expiration\\nBare metal instances, leases, and networks (including floating IPs): Deleted immediately after allocation expiration\\nStorage resources (private images, volumes, object stores, Jupyter volumes): Retained for 1 year after allocation expiration\\nPublic resources (public images and object store buckets): Retained for 5 years after allocation expiration\\nSSH keys: Retained for the lifetime of your project\\n\\nTo prevent unintended data loss, consider: (1) keeping your allocation active through renewal, (2) downloading important data before your allocation expires, or (3) making valuable resources public to extend their retention period.\\n\\xa0\\nWho can use Chameleon?\\nChameleon is broadly available to members of the US Computer Science research community and its international collaborators working in the open community on cloud research. By emphasizing “open” we mean that the expectation is that any research performed on Chameleon will result in publication in a broadly available journal or conference.\\n\\xa0\\nWho is eligible to be Chameleon PI?\\nChameleon PIs carry significant responsibility for the users on their projects; we therefore limit PI eligibility to individual from the following groups:\\n\\nAcademic institutions: This eligibility criterion covers research scientists, research staff, and faculty members in supervisory positions at academic institutions. Graduate and PhD student researchers (including those serving as paid research assistants) are not typically considered eligible for PI status on Chameleon. Students should instead ask their faculty advisor to request PI status and give them access to a project.\\nFederal agencies such as national labs, R&D centers, and institutes: Research staff employed by federal agencies or non-NSF Federally Funded R&D Centers (FFRDCs) are eligible to apply for an allocation.\\nIndependent museums, observatories, libraries, research laboratories, professional societies and similar organizations in the United States that are directly associated with educational or research activities are eligible.\\nInternational research institutions: to promote intellectual exchange and federation with institutions abroad we support a limited number of international PIs with ongoing, active collaborations with scientists in the US.\\nNSF Graduate Student Fellows: While in most cases, a graduate student is ineligible to be PI of an allocation request, an exception is made for NSF Graduate Student Fellows. Recipients of these NSF awards can submit requests for Startup allocations as long as they include supporting documentation (grant number or an award letter) as part of the request submission.\\nState educational offices or organizations and local school districts may submit allocation requests intended to broaden the impact, accelerate the pace, and increase the effectiveness of improvements in science, mathematics, and engineering education in both K-12 and post-secondary levels. A teacher or educator at an accredited public or private K-12 school is eligible to apply for an allocation as PI.\\n\\nWe do occasionally provide case-by-case exceptions to this guideline in well-justified cases.\\n\\xa0\\nTips and Tricks\\nHow do I make sure that my PI status is reflected in my profile?\\nIf you are eligible to be PI (you can verify in\\xa0this section), in order to apply for a project you need to make sure that your Chameleon profile reflects your status. You can do so on the Edit Account Profile page. Simply check the \"Request PI Eligibility\" checkbox and save you Account Profile.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nHow can I extend a Chameleon lease?\\nAn active Chameleon lease within 48 hours of its end time can be prolonged by up to 7 days from the moment of request if resources are available. To prolong a lease, click on the “Update Lease” button in the Reservations panel of the CHI OpenStack dashboard, and enter the additional duration requested in the “Prolong for” boxes. If there is an advance reservation blocking your lease prolongation that could potentially be moved, you can interact through the users mailing list to coordinate with others users.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat if I need a lease that is longer than the limitation (i.e., 7 days)?\\nIf you know from the start that your lease has will require more than a week and cannot be broken into two or more 7 day leases because of the nature of the experiment, you can contact Chameleon staff via the ticketing system to request a one-time exception to create a longer lease. The request has to be submitted by the project PI and should contain a detailed justification for why a contiguous lease is needed. Please note, that these requests may take a longer time to consider as needed to understand all the details.\\n\\xa0\\nI am new to SSH, how do I create my own SSH key pairs on Linux/macOS?\\nWhenever you are creating an instance in Chameleon, you will have an option to select an Public SSH Key imported from your desktop. Once selected, this public key will be inserted into the instance\\'s ~/.ssh/known_hosts file. When a user attempts to connect to the instance, the private key provided by the user will be validated against this public key in the known_hosts file. These instructions will help you create an SSH key pair and log in to your instance on Chameleon.\\nFor Linux/ Mac OS X\\nOpen a terminal window:\\n\\nIn a Mac OS X system, click on your launchpad and search for terminal\\nIn an Ubuntu system you can use the keys Ctrl+Alt+T (for desktop version)\\n\\nAccess the SSH key pairs directory; in your terminal type the command:\\ncd ~/.ssh\\nCreate your ssh key pair (public and private keys); in the .ssh directory, type the command:\\nssh-keygen\\nPress the enter key, then enter a name for your key.\\nAfter completing the previous step, a message stating “Enter file in which to save the Key” will be displayed. Enter the name of your preference. I will use in this example the name “sample-key”. Then press the enter key.\\nThen, you will be requested to enter a passphrase for your key. Entering a passphrase is not necessary, so you can proceed to leave it blank and press enter. You will receive a message “Enter same passphrase again:” so just leave it blank and press enter.\\nSince we are still in the .ssh directory, now you can see your newly created key by typing ls.\\nYou will see two files:\\n\\nsample-key (containing the private key)\\nsample-key.pub (containing the public key)\\n\\nYou may view your sample-key.pub contents by typing:\\ncat sample-key.pub\\nSelect and copy the contents displayed starting ssh-rsa all the way to the end. To add a key pair in Chameleon, follow the instructions for importing key pair and paste the contents of the key in the Public Key text entry.\\nAfter you have created a key pair and imported it in Chameleon, you can connect to any instance configured with this key pair. To do so you can use the command:\\nssh -i ~/.ssh/sample-key cc@<instance ip address>\\nFor Windows\\nFirst, download and install PuTTY and PuTTYgen from here. Once downloaded, opening PuTTYgen will open a key generator window, seen below.\\nI can\\'t\\xa0ping or SSH to my instance, what are some good things to try?\\nWhile the possibility that the system is being taking over by nanites should not be discounted too easily, it is always prudent to first check for the following issues:\\n\\nDo you have a floating IP associated with your instance? By default, instances do not have publicly-accessible IP addresses assigned. See our documentation on\\xa0associating a floating ip.\\nKVM only: Does your security group allow incoming ICMP (e.g. ping) traffic? By default, firewall rules do not allow ping to your instances. If you wish to enable it, see our documentation on\\xa0security group.\\nKVM only: Does your security group allow incoming SSH (TCP port 22) traffic? By default, firewall rules do not allow SSH to your instances. If you wish to enable it, see our documentation on\\xa0security group.\\n\\nIf none of these solve your problem, please\\xa0open a ticket with our help desk, and send us the results of the above (and any evidence of nanites you find as well).\\n\\xa0\\nWhy are my\\xa0instances failing to launch?\\nThe Chameleon Bare Metal clouds require users to reserve resources before allowing them to launch instances. Please follow the documentation on\\xa0making reservations\\xa0and make sure that:\\n\\nYou have created a lease with physical nodes and it has started (the associated reservation is shown as \\'Active\\')\\nYou have selected your reservation in the Launch Instance panel\\nYou don\\'t over-use your reservation\\n\\nIf you get an error stating that \\'No valid host was found\\', it might be caused by a lack of resources in the cloud. The Chameleon staff continuously monitors the utilization of the testbed, but there might be times when no more resources are available. If the error persists, please\\xa0open a ticket with our help desk.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat does CHI mean?\\nCHI stands for Chameleon Infrastructure, and refers to the technology powering our bare-metal clouds: a combination of software components from OpenStack, Grid\\'5000, and our own developments.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat is CHI-in-a-box?\\nCHI-in-a-box is a packaging of the implementation of the core services that together constitute the Chameleon testbed for experimental Computer Science research. These services allow Chameleon users to discover information about Chameleon resources, allocate those resources for present and future use, configure them in various ways, and monitor various types of metrics.\\nWhile a large part of CHI (CHameleon Infrastructure) is based on an open source project (OpenStack), and all the extensions we made are likewise open source, without proper packaging there was no clear recipe on how to combine them and configure a testbed of this type. CHI-in-a-box is composed of the following three components: (a) open source dependencies supported by external projects (e.g., OpenStack and Grid’5000), (b) open source extensions made by the Chameleon team, both ones that are scheduled to be integrated into the original project (but have not been yet) and ones that are specific to the testbed, and (c) new code written by the team released under the Apache License 2.0.\\nWe have identified demand for three types of scenarios in which users would like to use a packaging of Chameleon infrastructure:\\nChameleon Associate: In this scenario a provider wants to add resources to the Chameleon testbed such that they are discoverable and available to all Chameleon users while retaining their own project identity (via branding, usage reports, some of the policies, etc.). This type of provider will provide system administration of their resources (hardware configuration and operation as well as CHI administration with the support of the Chameleon team) and use the Chameleon user services (user/project management, etc.), user portal, resource discovery, and appliance catalog. All user support will be provided by the Chameleon team.\\nChameleon Part-time Associate: This scenario is similar to the Chameleon Associate but while the resources are available to the testbed users most of the time, the provider anticipates that they may want to take them offline for extended periods of time for other uses. In this scenario Chameleon support extends only to the time resources are available to the testbed.\\nIndependent Testbed: In this scenario a provider wants to create a testbed that is in every way separate from Chameleon. This type of provider will use CHI for the core testbed services only and operate their user services (i.e., manage their own user accounts and/or projects, help desk, mailing lists and other communication channels, etc.), user portal, resource discovery, and appliance catalog (some of those services can in principle be left out at the cost of providing a less friendly interface to users). This scenario will be supported on a best effort basis only.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat is a Jupyter Notebook?\\nDeveloped by Project Jupyter, the Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application where you can create rich documents that marry code, data, documentation, and visualization. Jupyter Notebooks are used in many fields for the collection and analysis of data, and we are now seeing explorations of their use in the research sphere. All Chameleon users can get their own Jupyter Notebook server provisioned automatically by going to the Chameleon JupyterHub server and logging in with their Chameleon credentials. Chameleon Notebook servers come pre-installed with some convenience libraries to make it easier to interact with the Chameleon testbed. See the Jupyter Notebook documentation for more details.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat is Trovi?\\nChameleon Trovi\\xa0is a sharing portal that allows you to share digital research and education artifacts, such as packaged experiments, workshop tutorials, or class materials. Each research artifact is represented as a deposition (a remotely accessible folder) where a user can put Jupyter notebooks, links to images, orchestration templates, data, software, and other digital representations that together represent a focused contribution that can be run on Chameleon. Users can use these artifacts to recreate and rerun experiments or class exercises on a Jupyter Notebook within Chameleon. They can also create their own artifacts and publish them directly to Trovi from within\\xa0Chameleon’s Jupyter server. You can learn\\xa0more\\xa0in the Trovi documentation.\\n\\xa0\\nHow do I reserve GigaIO Composable Hardware?\\nTo reserve our new composable hardware, please follow these steps:\\n\\n\\nReview the background information\\nRead our blog post on GigaIO Hardware for an overview of the technology and its capabilities.\\n\\n\\nUnderstand the reservation process\\n\\nYou need to reserve multiple nodes to access multiple GPUs, even if you plan to compose a system with multiple GPUs on one node.\\nEach node\\'s \"default\" configuration is available in the reference-api and for reservation.\\nExample: To reserve 4 GPUs and 1 node, you\\'ll need to reserve all 4 nodes, as each node \"comes with\" one GPU.\\n\\n\\n\\nMake your reservation\\nUse the standard reservation process to book the required number of nodes.\\n\\n\\nRequest reconfiguration\\nAfter making your reservation, submit a helpdesk ticket with the title \"Composable Hardware Configuration Request.\" We will trigger the re-composition of the resources when your reservation starts.\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: Due to the complexity of reconfiguring the switch fabric, we do not currently have an API for direct reconfiguration. Our team will handle the reconfiguration based on your helpdesk ticket.\\n\\nFor any questions or assistance, please don\\'t hesitate to contact our support team.\\n\\xa0\\nFederated Login\\nWhat is federated login?\\nFederated login enables users to use a single set of credentials to log into many different services. For example, federated login allows you to use your university or other institutional credentials to log into Chameleon -- there is no need to create a new account. In addition, since federated login is supported by many testbeds and services across scientific infrastructures you will be able to sign in once and use multiple services. For example, users who have allocation on both the\\xa0CloudBank and Chameleon testbeds will be able to sign into one of them and use both. Users who have allocation on both\\xa0GENI and Chameleon testbeds will likewise be able to access both by signing in only once. And users who use\\xa0Globus services and Chameleon at the same time will be able to use both as well.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nWhy did Chameleon move to federated login?\\nFederated login has many advantages for our users: it makes it easier to log into Chameleon, reduces the number of accounts a user has to create to use scientific infrastructure, and makes using testbeds and tools in conjunction much easier by supporting single sign-on across multiple services. The latter also makes it easier for Chameleon to add new integrated services -- for example, this move to federated login will enable support for single sign-on for Jupyter on Chameleon. Finally, long-term it will allow us to scale the testbed to many sites more efficiently and securely.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nHow is federated login implemented on Chameleon?\\nChameleon uses Globus Auth, a popular authentication service, to implement federated login. New users can sign up via their existing host institution account, use their Google account, or create a Globus ID tied to an email and password that they provide.\\n\\xa0\\nIt looks like I have multiple set of credentials that I could log in with: which one should I choose?\\nIn many cases, our uses will be able to use multiple identities to gain access to the testbed: this happens for example if your institution is part of InCommon\\xa0and you also have a Google account. Is one set of credentials better to use than another? This largely depends on your preferences and the nature of your work. Many users like to use their Google account in a “lingua franca”, access everything capacity: it has the advantage of simplicity. On the other hand, if you use infrastructure based on InCommon\\xa0login (such as GENI\\xa0or CloudBank) in conjunction with Chameleon, logging in via credentials linked to one of the InCommon institutions will have the advantage that you need to authenticate only once in order to access both infrastructures. Note that no specific set of credentials is permanently linked to your CHameleon access: so if you you choose to log in with Google account one time, you may choose your institutional credentials another time without changes to your authentication workflow.\\n\\nWhat entities is Chameleon federated with?\\nSince Chameleon uses Globus Auth, it is federated with identities supported via InCommon, Google, and Globus ID. Additionally, we also support the TAS entity. For most of you, the good news is probably that you can log in with your google account!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nWhat will moving to federated identity mean for me in the short-term?\\nThe move to federated identity effectively creates a new account for each user. This means that data associated with your current Chameleon account, such as keypairs, any disk image snapshots published to your project(s) via cc-snapshot, experimental metrics and Experiment Precis\\xa0data for old experiments and leases, RC files for CLI usage, as well as active instances and leases will NOT be available from your new account.\\xa0\\nWe implemented a migration process that will automatically copy your keypairs and share your images with the new account. Please, bear in mind that the migration process works only one way -- from your old to your new account -- in other words, new images and keypairs created under your new account will not be available under your old account. You will however be able to apply the migration process multiple times throughout the migration period to apply updates made under your old account.\\xa0 Migrating any other data will be your responsibility -- but as always, please contact us via the help desk\\xa0(the sooner the better) and we will do our best to help!\\nDue to the fact that data will not be shared automatically between accounts, users working on collaborative projects may want to coordinate migration activities to ensure that everybody uses either old or federated accounts.\\xa0\\nPlease, note that during the migration period (October and November of 2020) you will be able to log in to both the old and the new account so that you can finish your work and migrate data as needed. However, after the migration period the data associated with your old account may be lost.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nWhat is the schedule for migration to federated identity?\\nOctober 12th:\\nNew federated login with migration support becomes available; users can use it on an opt-in basis since old login remains supported till the end of November\\nOctober 19th:\\xa0\\nThe existing Chameleon account creation feature becomes disabled; all new Chameleon users will be logging in with federated login\\nNovember 1st:\\nThe “Log in with GENI” feature goes away (users can use federated login to log into Chameleon with their GENI credentials) and federated login becomes the default login option (though you will also be able to log in “the old way” by following a link)\\nDecember 1st:\\nFederated login becomes the only login option; please make sure to migrate to the new account by then!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nHow do I migrate to federated identity on Chameleon?\\nTo migrate, please follow our migration instructions.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nWhat changes should I expect when working with a federated identity management?\\nA federated identity creates a login context over potentially multiple infrastructures and tools; these tools refresh their login information based on this context. This provides a single sign-on over multiple tools (it may take a few clicks in some cases though you will likely not have to enter a password). It may also mean that logging out of one of those tools will not affect your login status with others, and when you try to log in again your context will be refreshed based on the federated login context (i.e., you won’t be prompted for a password). In order to ensure that you have logged out completely, after you log out of Chameleon, you should also terminate your session with your federated identity provider--this could mean logging out of your Google account, or perhaps your InCommon institution.\\n\\xa0\\nAppliances\\nWhat is an appliance?\\nAn appliance is an application packaged together with the environment that this application requires. For example, an appliance can consists of the operating system, libraries and tools used by the application, configuration features such as environment variable settings, and the installation of the application itself. Examples of appliances might include a KVM virtual machine image, a Docker image, or a bare metal image. Chameleon appliance refers to bare metal images that can be deployed on the Chameleon testbed. Since an appliance captures the experimental environment exactly, it is a key element of reproducibility; publishing an appliance used to obtain experimental results will go a long way to allowing others to reproduce and build on your research easily.\\nTo deploy distributed applications on several Chameleon instances, complex appliances combine an image and a template describing how the cluster should be configured and contextualized. You can read more about them in the complex appliance documentation.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat is the Chameleon Appliance Catalog?\\nThe Chameleon Appliance Catalog is a repository that allows users to discover, publish, and share appliances. The appliance catalog contains useful images of both bare metal and virtual machine appliances supported by the Chameleon team as well appliances contributed by users.\\n\\xa0\\nHow to build or customize a Chameleon appliance?\\nThere are two options to build or customize a Chameleon appliance -- the cc-snapshot utility and the OpenStack diskimage-builder.\\nThe cc-snapshot-utility\\nThe cc-snapshot tool is pre-installed in all Chameleon supported appliances and it provides a quick and easy way to customize a Chameleon appliance. To start, spin up an instance with the Chameleon appliance you would like to customize. Then install the libraries and tools you would like to add into your new appliance, or uninstall things you want to exclude from your new appliance. Finally, take a snapshot by running the cc-snapshot command.\\nThe OpenStack diskimage-builder\\nYou can use diskimage-builder to build your appliance from scratch or customize the Chameleon appliances by using the code on Github as templates (CC-CentOS7, CC-Ubuntu14.04, CC-Ubuntu16.04). The OpenStack diskimage-builder provides a more manageable way of building appliances. For more information about OpenStack diskimage-builder, please see the OpenStack documentation.\\n\\xa0\\nHow do I publish an appliance in the Chameleon Appliance Catalog?\\nThe new Appliance Catalog allows you to easily publish and share your own appliances so that others can discover them and use them either to reproduce the research of others or as a basis for their own research. Before creating your own appliance it is advisable to review other appliances on the Chameleon Appliance Catalog in order to get an idea of the categories you will want to contribute and what others have done.\\nTwo methods exist to submit an appliance to the Appliance Catalog. They can be added using the simplified process available through the Images view. They can also be added using the manual process as described below:\\n\\nCreate the appliance itself. You may want to test it as well as give some thought to what support you are willing to provide for the appliance (e.g., if your group developed and supports a software package, the appliance may be just a new way of packaging the software and making it available, in which case your standard support channels may be appropriate for the appliance as well).\\nUpload the appliance to the Chameleon Image Repository (Glance) and make the image public. In order to enter the appliance into the Catalog you will be asked to provide the Glance ID for the image. These IDs are per-cloud, so that there are three options right now: bare metal/CHI at University of Chicago, bare metal/CHI at TACC, and OpenStack/KVM at TACC. You will need to provide at least one appliance, but may want to provide all three.\\nGo to the Appliance Catalog Create Appliance web form, fill out, and submit the form. Be prepared to provide the following information: a descriptive name (this sometimes requires some thought!), author and support contact, version, and an informative description. The description is a very important part of the appliance record; others will use it to evaluate if the appliance contains tools they need for their research so it makes sense to prepare it carefully. To make your description effective you may want to think of the following questions: what does the appliance contain? what are the specific packages and their versions? what is it useful for? where can it be deployed and/or what restrictions/limitations does it have? how should users connect to it / what accounts are enabled?\\n\\nIf you are adding a complex appliance, skip the image ID fields and enter your template instead in the dedicated text box.\\nAs always, if you encounter any problems or want to share with us additional improvements we should do to the process, please don’t hesitate to submit a ticket.\\n\\xa0\\nHow can I manage an appliance on Chameleon Appliance Catalog?\\nIf you are the owner of the appliance, you can edit the appliance data, such as the description or the support information. Browse to the appliance that you want to edit and view its Details page. At the top right of the page is an Edit button. You will be presented with the same web form as when creating the appliance, pre-filled with the appliances current information. Make changes as necessary and click Save at the bottom of the page.\\nAnd finally, you can delete appliances you had made available. Browse to the appliance that you want to delete and click Edit on the Appliance Details page. At the bottom of the page is a Delete button. You will be asked to confirm once more that you do want to delete this appliance. After confirming, the appliance will be removed and no longer listed on the Appliance Catalog.\\n\\xa0\\nWhy are there different image IDs for KVM@TACC, CHI@TACC, and CHI@UC for the same appliance?\\nThe three clouds forming the Chameleon testbed are fully separated, each having its own Glance image repository. The same appliance image uploaded to the three clouds will produce three different image IDs. In addition, it is sometimes needed to customize an appliance image for each site, resulting in slightly different image files.\\n\\xa0\\nCan I use Ubuntu, Debian, or another operating system rather than CentOS on bare-metal?\\nThe recommended appliance for Chameleon is CentOS 7 (supported by Chameleon staff), or appliances built on top of it.\\nThese appliances provide Chameleon-specific customizations, such as login using the cc account, the cc-checks utility to verify hardware against our resource registry, gathering of metrics, etc. Since 2016, we also provide and support Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 appliances with the same functionality.\\n\\xa0\\nThe cc-snapshot tool doesn\\'t work on previously snapshot images.\\nThe cc-snapshot is occasionally updated to accommodate changes to the infrastructure and distributions. To replace the script in your image, follow our instructions for updating cc-snapshot.\\n\\xa0\\nHow do I move images between sites?\\nChameleon bare-metal sites -- CHI@TACC and ``CHI@UC`` -- belong to a single OpenStack deployment as two :ref:`independent <bare-metal-sites-independent>` regions.\\nYou can move images between sites by using the :ref:`command line interface <cli>`. Make sure you have :ref:`installed CLI properly <cli-installing>` and :ref:`configured the environment variables using the rc script <cli-rc-script>`.\\n\\nDownload the image from the source site to local\\n\\nopenstack --os-region-name <source_site [CHI@TACC or CHI@UC]> image save <image_name> --file <filename>\\n\\nUpload the image to the target site from local\\n\\nopenstack --os-region-name <target_site [CHI@TACC or CHI@UC]> image create --file <filename> --disk-format <format> <image_name>\\nYou can get disk-format from the output of the following command:\\nopenstack --os-region-name <source_site [CHI@TACC or CHI@UC]> image show <image_name>\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Chameleon is funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation.\\n    \\nAbout\\nDocumentation\\nHelp Desk\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')]\n"

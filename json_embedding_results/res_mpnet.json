Chameleon is built over two sites, the University of Chicago and TACC, offering a total of over 550 nodes and 5 PB of space in twelve\nStandard Cloud Unit (SCU) racks\n. To effectively support Computer Science experiments, Chameleon offers bare metal reconfigurability on most of the hardware. To provide easy access to educational users, two SCUs at TACC (one sixth of the testbed) are configured with OpenStack KVM.
